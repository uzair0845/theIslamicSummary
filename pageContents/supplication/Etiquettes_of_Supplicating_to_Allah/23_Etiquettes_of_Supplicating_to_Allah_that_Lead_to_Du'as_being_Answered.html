        <div>Allah said:</div>

    <li>
        <div><u>Begin the supplication with praise of Allah and extolling him, then send salah upon the Prophet:</u></div>
        <div>Anas narrated: "Every supplication is screened until the salah is sent upon the Prophet (pbuh)".<sup></sup></div>
        <div>Fadalah Ibn 'Ubaid narrated: While the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was seated, a man entered and performed prayer and said: 'O Allah, forgive me, and have mercy upon me.' The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: 'You have rushed, O praying person. When you perform Prayer and sit, praise Allah with what He is deserving of, and send Salah upon me, then call upon Him (Allah).' He said: 'Then another man performed Prayer after that, so he praised Allah and sent Salah upon the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) said to him: 'O praying person! Supplicate, and you shall be answered!'<sup></sup></div>

    <li>
        <div><u>Be assertive in supplicating, without hesitation — and be certain that you'll receive a response in one way or another:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Let not any of you say: O Allah! Forgive me if you wish. O Allah! Show me mercy if you wish. Rather ask from Allah with certitude for no one has the power to compel Allah.<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>Be persistent in invoking Allah with du'a and do not be hasty or impatient:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh)) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Allah will answer each one of you so long as he is not impatient (hasty) and says: 'I supplicated and I was not answered.'<sup></sup></div>
        <div>In a wording:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">A person says: 'I supplicated and I supplicated and I was not answered. And then he gets frustrated and abandons making du'a.'<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>Have a presence and alertness of the heart when supplicating:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Call upon Allah whilst you are certain of a response - and know that Allah does not respond to the du'a of a person whose heart is inattentive and occupied with play.<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>Supplicate to Allah in times of ease and He will answer you in times of hardship:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div>Whoever desires that Allah answers him in times of hardship and distress, then he should be plentiful in supplicating to Him in times of ease.<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>Do not ask from anyone except Allah, relying on Him totally:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh) said:</div>

    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>Do not supplicate against your family or your wealth:</u></div>
        <div>The Prophet (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Do not invoke a curse on yourselves. Do not invoke a curse on your children. Do not invoke a curse on your servants. Do not invoke a curse on your property. You may happen to do it at a time when Allah is asked for something and He grants your request!<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><u>The one making du'a should keep his voice moderate somewhere between quiet and audible:</u></div>
        <div>Allah stated:</div>
        <div verse="7:55" class="bulletArabic"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.</div>
        <div>Abu Musa narrated:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">We were along with Allah's Messenger (pbuh) on a journey when the people began to pronounce Allāhu Akbar in a loud voice. So Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: "O people, show mercy to yourselves for you are not calling One who is deaf or absent. Verily, you are calling One who is All-Hearing, near to you and is with you."</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Abu Musa said: I was behind the Prophet and I was saying: لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّ "There is neither might nor power but that of Allah." So the Prophet said: "O 'Abdullah Ibn Qays! Should I not direct you to a treasure from amongst the treasures of Paradise?" I said: "Of course O Allah's Messenger!" Thereupon the Prophet said: "Then say: لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّ 'There is no might and no power but that of Allah.'"<sup></sup></div>

        <div><u>Invoke Allah by His beautiful Names and lofty Attributes or by asking a righteous person to supplicate:</u></div>
        <div class='bulletArabic' verse='7:180'>وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَائِهِ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">And all the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.</div>
        <div>Abdullah Ibn Buraidah from his father that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) heard a man saying:</div>
        <div class='bulletArabic'>اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ أَنِّي أَشْهَدُ أَنَّكَ أَنْتَ اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ الأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">O Allah, I ask You and I bear witness that you are Allah. There is no god worthy of worship besides You, the One, He is Self-Sufficient Master, upon Whom all creatures depend, He neither eats nor drinks, He begets not, nor was He begotten, And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.” The Prophet said: “You have supplicated Allah using His Greatest Name, when asked with this name He gives, and when supplicated by this name he answers.<sup></sup></div>

    <li>
        <div><u>Accepting one's sins and affirming Allah's bounty:</u></div>
        <div>Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said:</div>

        <div class='bulletQuote'>O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no god worthy of worship but You. You have created me and I am Your slave and I am keeping my promise and covenant to You as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge Your blessing and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for there is none who can forgive sin except You.<sup></sup></div>

        <div><u>Avoid the use of rhymed speech and rhymed prose in your Du'a to Allah:</u></div>
        <div>This has now become common when reciters supplicate. It is wrong, so beware because it is not from the Sunnah. Ibn 'Abbas said,</div>
        <div class='bulletQuote'>Preach to the people once a week, and if you want to do more, then preach to them twice a week, and if you want to preach more, then let it be three times a week only. Do not make the people fed-up with this Qur'an. If you come to some people who are engaged in conversation, do not interrupt them by preaching because you may bore. You should rather keep quiet, and if they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say. And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and his companions always avoided it.<sup></sup></div>
