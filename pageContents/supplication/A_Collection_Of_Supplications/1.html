    O Allah! Rectify my religion for me, which is the safeguard of my affairs; rectify my worldly [affairs], wherein is my livelihood; and rectify my Afterlife to which is my return; and make life for me [as a means of] increase in every good and make death for me as a rest from every evil.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    [اللَّهُمَّ أَصْلِحْ لِي دِينِي – O Allah! Rectify my religion for me] - Meaning:  Asking Allaah for the rectification of one's religion- to be blessed with the ability and guidance to fulfil its obligations, etiquettes and requirements in a perfect and complete manner; blessed with the guidance and ability to adhere to the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah based on the path of the Salafus Saaleh – the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een and the righteous Imaams- in affairs related to sound creed, worship, Dawah [i.e. the sound method of calling to the path of Allaah] and good social behaviour in general. [الَّذِي هُوَ عِصْمَةُ أَمْرِي– which is the safeguard of my affairs]- Meaning: The affair through which all my affairs will be protected.
</p>
<p>
    This shows the fact that adherence to the religion based on the sound methodology [of the Salaf] is a means to safety for the person – [a safeguard] against the misleading trials and against falling into deviation in creed and deeds; and that not adhering to the religion is the reason behind ruining one's affairs.
</p>
<p>
    [وَأَصْلِحْ لِي دُنْيَايَ – And rectify my worldly (affairs)] - Meaning: Asking Allaah to rectify one's worldly affairs - to be granted sufficiency in what one needs and through permissible means, as well as making it a means that aids one to obey Allaah. [الَّتِي فِيهَا مَعَاشِي– wherein is my livelihood] - Meaning: In my livelihood and my life. This shows that people have a specified livelihood and a determined provision.
</p>
<p>
    [وَأَصْلِحْ لِي آخِرَتِي – And rectify my Afterlife]- Meaning: Asking Allaah to make one’s affairs upright in the afterlife – to receive Allaah’s Kindness, guidance and ability to obey Him [and the Messenger]; granted a righteous departure from this life and success through eternal bliss in paradise. [الَّتِي فِيهَا مَعَادِي – to which is my return]- Meaning: My place of return and my return to Allaah.
</p>
<p>
    [وَاجْعَلِ الْحَيَاةَ زِيَادَةً لِي فِي كُلِّ خَيْرٍ – And make life for me (as a means of) increase in every good - Meaning: Make the duration of lifespan an opportunity and a means of attaining good in speech and deeds. This shows that the duration of person's lifespan is a motive for increasing in righteous and good deeds.
</p>
<p>
    [وَاجْعَلِ الْمَوْتَ رَاحَةً لِي مِنْ كُلِّ شَرٍّ– And make death for me as a rest from every evil] - Meaning: Make death and my departure from this worldly life a means of rest; and not trials, tests and calamities through sinning and heedlessness.<sup></sup>
