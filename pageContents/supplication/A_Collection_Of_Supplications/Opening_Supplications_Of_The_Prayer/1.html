<p>Next, he pbuh would commence his recitation with many kinds of supplications in which he would praise Allaah the Exalted, and glorify and extol Him. He in fact ordered "the man who prayed badly" to do so, saying to him:</p>
<p class='quote'>No person's prayer is complete unless he says takbeer, praises Allaah the Mighty and Sublime and extols Him, recites of the Qur.aan what is easy for him...<sup></sup></p>

<p>He would say any one of the following supplications:</p>
<p class="arabic">اللَّهُمَّ بَاعِدْ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ خَطَايَايَ كَمَا بَاعَدْتَ بَيْنَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ، اللَّهُمَّ نَقِّنِي مِنْ خَطَايَايَ، كَمَا يُنَقَّى الثَّوْبُ الْأَ بْيَضُ مِنَ الدَّنَسِ، اللَّهُمَّ اغْسِلْنِي مِنْ خَطَايَايَ بِالثَّلْجِ وَالْمَاءِ وَالْبَرَدِ.</p>
<p class='quote'>O Allaah! Separate me (far) from my sins as you have separated (far) the East and West. O Allaah! Cleanse me of my sins as white cloth is cleansed from dirt. O Allaah! Wash me of my sins with water, ice and snow.</p>
<p>He used to say this in obligatory prayers<sup></sup>.</p>
<p class="arabic">وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهي لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأرْضَ حَنِيفًا [مسلما]، وَما أَنَا مِنَ المُشْرِكِينَ، إنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي، وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ، لا شَرِيكَ له، وَبِذلكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا مِنَ المُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ المَلِكُ لا إلَهَ إلَّا أَنْتَ، سُبْحانَكَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَنْتَ رَبِّي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ، ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي، وَاعْتَرَفْتُ بذَنْبِي، فَاغْفِرْ لي ذُنُوبِي جَمِيعًا، إنَّه لا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إلَّا أَنْتَ، وَأَهْدِنِي لأَحْسَنِ الأخْلَاقِ، لا يَهْدِي لأَحْسَنِهَا إلَّا أَنْتَ، وَاصْرِفْ عَنِّي سَيِّئَهَا، لا يَصْرِفُ عَنِّي سَيِّئَهَا إلَّا أَنْتَ، لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ، وَالْخَيْرُ كُلُّهُ في يَدَيْكَ، وَالشَّرُّ ليسَ إلَيْكَ، والمَهْدِيٌّ مَن هديتَ، أَنَا بكَ وإلَيْكَ، لا منجا ولا مَلْجَأَ مِنكَ إلا إليك، تَبَارَكْتَ وَتَعَالَيْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إلَيْكَ</p>
<p class='quote'>I have set my face towards the Originator of the heavens and the earth sincerely [in Islam] and I am not among the Mushrikeen. Indeed my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds: no partner has He. With this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims (those who submit to Him)<sup></sup>. O Allaah! You are the King, none has the right to br worshipped but You, [You are the Most Perfect and all Praise is for You] You are my Lord and I am Your slave<sup></sup>. I have wronged myself, and have acknowledged my sins, so forgive all my sins, for no-one forgives sins except You.

<p>He used to say this in obligatory and voluntary prayers<sup></sup>.</p>

<p>Similar to the above, without:</p>

<p class='quote'>You are my Lord and I am Your slave to the end</p>
<p>with the following addition:</p>

<p class='quote'>and I am the first of the Muslims,</p>
<p>adding:</p>

<p class='quote'>You are Glorified<sup></sup>, O Allaah, and Praised<sup></sup>; Your Name is Blessed<sup></sup>; Your Majesty<sup></sup> is Exalted, and none has the right to worshipped but You<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>He pbuh also said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Indeed, the words most loved by Allaah are when His slave says: You are glorified, O Allaah<sup></sup></p>
<p>Similar to the above, adding in prayer at night:</p>
<p class="arabic">لا إلَهَ إلَّا أَنْتَ</p>

<p class='quote'>Allaah is the Greatest, very great. Praise be to Allaah, again and again. Glorified is Allaah morning and evening</p>
<p>One of the Companions commenced with this, to which the Messenger pbuh said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Wonderful for it (the supplication) is that the doors of the heavens were opened for it.<sup></sup></p>
<p class="arabic">الحمدُ لِلَّهِ حَمْدًا كثيرًا طَيِّبًا مُبارَكًا فيه</p>
<p class='quote'>Praise be to Allaah, many, pure, blessed praises</p>
<p>Another man commenced with this, to which he pbuh said:</p>
<p class='quote'>I saw twelve angels competing as to which of them would take it up.<sup></sup></p>

<p class="arabic">للهم لك الحمدُ، أنت نور السَّماوات والأرض ومَن فيهم، ولك الحمدُ، أنت قيّم السَّماوات والأرض ومَن فيهم، [ولك الحمدُ، أنت مَلِكُ السَّماوات والأرض ومَن فيهم]، ولك الحمدُ، أنت الحقُّ، وَعْدُكَ حقٌّ، وَقَوْلُكَ حَقٌّ، وَلِقاؤُكَ حَقٌّ، والجَنَّةُ حَقٌّ، والنار حق، والساعة حق، والنبيون حق، ومحمد حق، اللهم لك اسلمت، وعليك توكلت، وبك آمنت، واليك أنبت، وبك خاصمت واليك حاكمت، [أنتَ ربنا وإليكَ المصيرُ فَاغْفِرْ لي ما قدمتُ، وما أخَّرْتُ، وَما أسْرَرْتُ وما أعْلَنْتُ]، [وما أنتَ أَعْلَمُ بهِ مِنِّي]، أنتَ المُقَدِّمُ وأنتَ المُؤَخَّرُ، [أنت إلَهي]، لا إله إلا أنتَ.</p>
<p class='quote'>O Allaah, to You belongs all Praise. You are the Light<sup></sup> of the heavens and the earth and all those in them; to You belongs all Praise.

<p>He pbuh used to say this in prayer at night, as he did the following supplications:<sup></sup></p>
<p class="arabic">اللَّهمَّ ربَّ جبريلَ وميكائيلَ وإسرافيلَ فاطرَ السَّمواتِ والأرضِ عالِمَ الغيبِ والشَّهادةِ أنتَ تحكُمُ بينَ عبادِكَ فيما كانوا فيهِ يختلِفونَ إهدِني لما اختُلِفَ فيهِ منَ الحقِّ بإذنِكَ إنَّكَ تهدي من تشاءُ إلى صِراطٍ مستقيمٍ</p>

<p>He would say takbeer, tahmeed, tasbeeh, tahleel and istighfaar ten times each, and then say,</p>
<p class="arabic">اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي، وَأهْدِنِي، وَارْزُقْنِي، [وَعَافِنِي]</p>
<p class='quote'>O Allaah! forgive me and guide me and give me sustenance and [overlook my sins]</p>

    <li>Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ibn Abee Shaybah (12/110/2). It is given in Irwaa' (no. 8).</li>
    <li>Abu Daawood and al-Haakim, who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed.</li>
    <li>
        <div>It is thus in most of the narrations; in some, it is wa ana min al-muslimeen ("I am one of the Muslims"). It is likely that this is because of the mistake of one of the narrators, and other evidence points to that, so the worshipper should say: wa ana min al-muslimeen ("I am the first of the Muslims"). There is nothing wrong with that, contrary to what some people say under the impression that this means "I am the first person who has this quality, while the rest of the people do not." But it is not so; this phrase actually represents competing to fulfil orders - similar to this is:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="43:81"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Say: if the Merciful God has a son, then I am the first of the worshippers</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="7:143"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">and I am the first of the believers</div>
    </li>
    <li>Azharee said: i.e. 'I do not worship anything other than You.'</li>
    <li>labbaik: I am firmly and continually present in Your obedience; sa'dayk: extremely happy under Your order and devoutly following the deen which You have chosen.</li>
    <li>
        <div>i.e. Evil cannot be traced back to Allaah because there is nothing bad in His actions, for they are all good, ranging from justice to grace to wisdom, all of which are good with no bad in them. But evil is evil because it cannot be traced back to Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim (rahima-hullaah) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">He is the Creator of good and evil, but the evil exists in some of His creatures, not in His act of creating nor in His actions. Hence the Exalted is cleared of any zulm, which is fundamentally to put something in other than its proper place. He does not put anything except in its suitable place, so that is all good. But evil is to put something in other than its proper place: when it is put in its proper place it is not evil, so be sure that evil is not from Him. ...But if it is said: Why did He create something which is evil? I would say: He did the creating, and His action is good not evil, for creation and action is with Allaah, and it is impossible for evil to be with, or attributed to, Allaah. Anything evil in the created cannot be traced back to Allaah, but His actions and His creation can be attributed to Him, so they are good.</div>
        <div>The rest of this important discussion as well as its conclusion is to be found in his book Shifaa' al-'Aleel fee Masaa.il al-Qadaa' wal-Qadr wat-Ta'leel (pp. 178-206).</div>
