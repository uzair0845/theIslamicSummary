<p>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim [rahimahullaah] said:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    When Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubayr [may Allaah be pleased with him and his father] used to hear thunder, he would stop speaking and then say:
</p>
<p class='arabic'>سُبْحانَ الَّذِي يُسَبِّحُ الرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ، وَالمَلائِكَةُ مِنْ خِيْفَتِهِ</p>
<p class='quote'>Glorified be One and free is He from all imperfection, Whom the thunder glorifies and praises Him, and so do the angels because of His Awe</p>
<p>Allaah [The Exalted] said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='13:12-13'></p>
<p class='quote'>
    It is He who shows you the lightning, as a fear and as a hope. And it is He Who brings up (or originates) the clouds, heavy (with water). And Ar-Ra’d (thunder) glorifies and praises Him, and so do the angels because of His Awe, He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills, yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allah. And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment.
</p>
<p>Imaam As-Sadi [may Allaah have mercy upon him] stated:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    [It is He who shows you the lightning, as a fear and as a hope] - Meaning, fear of the thunderbolts, destruction and various types of harm to the crops and what is similar to them. And hoping for its good and benefits. [And it is He Who brings up (or originates) the clouds] – Meaning, heavy rain that benefits the people and the land. [And Ar-Ra’d (thunder) glorifies and praises Him]- Meaning, the sound – that is heard from the clouds which makes the people terrified – is under the absolute control of its Lord and glorifies and praises Him. [And so do the angels because of His Awe]- Meaning, they glorify and praise their Lord with a fear that is founded upon knowledge of the greatness of the One whom they fear (i.e. Allaah), and the complete and perfect Sovereignty and Dominion that is His.
</p>
<p class='quote'>
    And when it is the fact that He alone is the One Who gives rain to the servants and the clouds in which is a source of their provision, and that He alone is the One in absolute control of everything, and all the mighty creations – which people fear and makes then leaves them in a state of uneasiness – are under His control, and He is the One Mighty in Power; then he alone is the one who has the right to be worshipped without partner.
</p>
<p class='quote'>
    Allaah [The Most High] alone has the right to be worshipped with Al-Kawf [Fear]; Ar-Rajaa [Hope and longing]; Ar-Raghbah [Fervent Desire]; Ar-Rahbah [Dread] and Al-Inaabah [turning to Allaah in repentance]. That is because Allaah alone is the possessor of all the Names and Attributes of perfection – [and free is He from all imperfections, deficiencies, weaknesses, similarities, co-equals, faults, shortcomings etc].<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Al-Kawf [Fear]:</b> Fear is to be frightened and is a result of expecting something which will bring about destruction, harm or injury, and Allaah, the one free of all imperfections and the Most High, forbade having fear of the allies of the Satan, and He commanded fear of Himself alone. Fear is of three types:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>Natural fear, such as a person's fear of predatory animals, fire, or drowning. This is something for which a person is not to be blamed. Allaah, the Most High, said about Moosaa:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="28:18"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">So he entered in the morning in Pharaoh’s city in a state of fear, awaiting events.</div>
        <div>However if this fear is, as mentioned by the author, a cause of his leaving an obligation or doing something forbidden, then it is forbidden. Since whatever causes an obligation to be abandoned, or causes something forbidden to be done is itself forbidden (haraam). The evidence here is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="3:175"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">So do not fear them, but fear Me and beware of disobeying Me, if you are truly Believers.</div>
        <div>
            Furthermore fear of Allaah, the Most High, is sometimes something praiseworthy, and is sometimes something that is not praiseworthy. It is praiseworthy when it prevents you from being disobedient to Allaah, and causes you to fulfil the obligatory duties and to avoid what is forbidden. It is something that is not praiseworthy when it causes a person to despair of Allaah's Mercy and to give up hope altogether.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Reverential fear, that he fears something and takes that as his religion. This is to be for Allaah, the Most High, alone. Directing such reverential fear to anyone other than Allaah, the Most High, is major shirk.
    </li>
    <li>
        Secret supernatural fear, such as fearing someone buried in a grave, or a person thought to be pious, who is far away and cannot affect him, yet still he has secret fear for him. This is also mentioned by the scholars as being a case of shirk.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <b>Ar - Rajaa [Hope and longing]</b> is that a person wishes for something that may be attained and is close, and it may be something that is far off but treated as being something close. This earnest hope which comprises humility and submission may not be directed except to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and directing it to anyone other than Allaah, the Most High, is shirk. 'Hope' which is praiseworthy is only that which is found in a person who acts in obedience to Allaah and hopes for reward from Him, or a person who repents from sin and hopes that his repentance is accepted. As for a person who hopes despite the fact that he does not act, then this is delusion and false hopes, and is something blameworthy.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ar-Raghbah [Fervent Desire] and Ar-Rahbah [Dread]:</b> Ar-Raghbah is the love and desire to reach that which is beloved. Ar-Rahbah is fear which causes one to flee away from the cause of fear. So it is a fear that is accompanied by action.</p>
<p>
    the Believer should hasten to Allaah, the Most High, upon fear and earnest desire; with regard to actions of obedience his hope and earnest desire should predominate, so that he is keen to perform them and hopes that they will be accepted; and with regard to whenever he thinks of committing a sin, then fear should predominate so that he will flee away from doing it and be saved from its consequent punishment. Some scholars say that the aspect of hope should pre-dominate when a person is ill, and the aspect of fear when he is well.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Al-Inaabah:</b> is to turn to Allaah, the Most High, in obedience, and avoiding disobedience to Him, and its meaning is close to that of repentance (tawbah), except that it is more subtle in meaning, and conveys the sense of dependence upon Allaah and fleeing for refuge to Him, and it cannot be except for Allaah. Submission to Allaah, the Most High, is of two types:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Submission of all the creation, which is to submit to whatever He has decreed should exist and occur in the creation about which the creation has no choice.</li>
    <li>Submission to the laws and prescriptions of Islaam, and this is to submit in obedience. This is particular to those who are obedient to Allaah, the Messengers and those who follow them upon good.<sup></sup></li>
