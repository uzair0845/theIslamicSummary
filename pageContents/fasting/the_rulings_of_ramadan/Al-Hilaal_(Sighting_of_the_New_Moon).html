<h4>New moons determine Islamic Dates</h4>
<p>Allaah has set crescent sighting as the only means for establishing dates of various Islamic occasions such as the Eed and Hajj. He says:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:189'></p>
<p class='quote'>They ask you concerning the new moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for pilgrimage (hajj).</p>
<p>In particular the Messenger (pbuh) emphasized that crescent sighting is required in determining the beginning and the end of the month of Ramadaan. A large number of Companions reportet that the Messenger (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha'baan. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days.<sup></sup></p>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) took great care to determine precisely the beginning of Sha'ban, because one can count twenty nine days and watch for the crescent of Ramadaan or complete thirty days before starting to fast. Aa'eshah said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Messenger of Allaah (S) used to be more concerned about determining the beginning of Sha'baan than about other months. Then he used to fast at the sighting [of the crescent of Ramadaan]. If it were obscured, he would count thirty days [of Sha'baan] then fast.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Witnesses needed to establish the month</h4>
<p>The scholars agree that two trustworthy Muslim witnesses are sufficient to establish moon sighting. This is based on the reports of a large number of Companions, that the Messenger of Allaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class='quote'>If two just muslims testify (that they saw it) then fast or break your fast.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Many other scholars, however further believe that only one trustworthy person's testimony may be accepted as a basis for determining the beginning of the month. The basis for this is that Ibn Umar said:</p>
<p class='quote'>People were looking for the crescent [of Ramadaan]. I informed the Prophet (pbuh) that I saw it. So he fasted [on the following day] and ordered the people to fast.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Astronomical Evidence</h4>
<p>Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allaah (pbuh) said:.</p>
<p class='quote'>We are an illiterate nation. We do not use astronomical writing or computation [for our fasting]. A month is so and so (and he pointed with his hands three times, folding the thumb on the third time, meaning twenty-nine days) or so and so (and he pointed with his hands three times, meaning thirty days).<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Unification of Sighting Locations</h4>
<p>The above hadeeths carry a general command to all muslims to abide by the crescent sighting. In the same spirit, Abu Hurairah, Aa'eshah and others reported that the Messenger of Allaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class='quote'>[True] fasting starts on the day that you start fasting; [true] Fitr (that is Eed) is on the day that you end your fasting; [true] Adhaa (that is Eed) is on the day that you offer your sacrifice.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Thus, when the moon is sighted anywhere on the earth, by at least one trustworthy muslim, this means that the whole Ummah has sighted it. Based on this, as the above hadeeth indicates all members of the Ummah are required to observe the new month as long as the informatation reaches them in a reasonable amount of time to be able to act upon it.</p>
