<h4>Counting the Days of the month of Sha'baan</h4>
<p>It is imperative on the general body of muslims to take special care in counting the days of the month of Sha'baan in preparation for the month of Ramadhaan.</p>
<p>This is of great importance because the Islamic Month consists of twenty-nine or thirty days. The month starts with the sighting of the crescent which indicates its beginning. If however it is so cloudy that the crescent cannot be seen, then the thirtieth day of Sha'baan is completed and the new month (Ramadhaan) begins from the following day. Allaah has set up the moon for mankind as a means of keeping record of months and years. Based on this, therefore, the Islamic month does not exceed thirty days. This is also established in the Sunnah of the Messenger (pbuh). Abu Hurairah narrates that the Messenger (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class="quote">Fast whenever it (the new crescent) is sighted and break the fast when it is seen. If it is hidden from you (due to cloudiness) then complete thirty days for Sha'baan. [Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p>Abdullaah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class="quote">Do not fast until you see the crescent, and do not end (the month of) fasting until you see it. If it is covered from you (by clouds) then determine it (by counting thirty days). [Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p>Adee ibn Haatim said that the Messenger (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class="quote">When Ramadhaan comes along then fast for thirty days except if you see the hilaal (crescent) before it. [At-Tahaawee, Ahmad and Tabaraanee]</p>
