<p>Those for Whom the Fast During Ramadaan Is Not Obligatory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div><b>The traveller</b> can choose between fasting or not. Allah said, which means:</div>
        <div  class="bulletArabic" verse="2:185">وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍۢ فَعِدَّةٌۭ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۗ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">...And whoever of you is sick or on a journey, (let him fast) the same number of days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you...</div>
        <div>Anas bin Maalik said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">I was traveling with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) during Ramadaan. and those who fasted did not blame those who did not fast, and neither did those who did not fast blame those who fasted.<sup></sup></div>
        <div>From the following hadeeth we can deduce that it is better not to fast while on a journey. The Messenger (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Verily Allah loves that His concessions be accepted just as He hates to be disobeyed.<sup></sup></div>
        <div>It must be noted also that it is not righteousness for a weak traveller to fast as the Messenger (pbuh) said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">It is not righteousness that you fast while on journey.<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Sick person:</b> Because of His Mercy, Allah has allowed for the sick person not to fast, to make it easy on him. The type of sickness that allows a sick person not to fast is that which, if he fasts, would cause him harm or prolong the illness. And Allah knows best.</li>
    <li><b>States of Menses or Post-childbirth Bleeding:</b> The scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not allowed for the woman who is having her menstrual period and the woman who is affected with post-childbirth bleeding to fast. They should break their fast and make up the days later. They also agree that if they fast then no rewards would accrue to them.</li>
    <li><div><b>The Old Man and Old Woman:</b> Mujahid narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas recited:</div>
        <div  class="bulletArabic" verse="2:184">وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُۥ فِدْيَةٌۭ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍۢ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">... And as for those who cannot fast (with difficulty e.g. an old man), they have to feed a person (for every day) ...</div>
        <div>and then he pbuh said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">That refers to the old person who is not able to fast. He must feed a poor person a half saa' (two handfuls) of grains for everyday missed.</div>
        <div>Abu Huraira said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Whoever reaches old age and is not able to fast in Ramadaan, then for every day he must give away one mudd of wheat.<sup></sup></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><b>The pregnant and the breast-feeding women:</b> Anas Ibn Maalik said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">The horses of the Messenger of Allah pbuh came towards us, so I came up to the Messenger of Allah pbuh and I found him eating. He pbuh said: "Come closer and eat." I said: "I am fasting." He pbuh said: "Come closer and let me tell your about fasting. Indeed Allaah has reduced the salaat (prayer) for the traveller to the half and has removed the burden of the fasting from the pregnant and the breast-feeding woman...<sup></sup></div>
