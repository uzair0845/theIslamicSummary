</p>

<p>
    In this short treatise, Imaam Muhammad bin 'Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, briefly outlines the nine conditions for the acceptance of one's prayer, as well as the fourteen pillars and eight requirements of the prayer, mentioning some of their proofs and evidences from the Book and the Sunnah.
</p>

<p>
    A condition is something that is required before the commencement of prayer in order for it to be valid. The pillars are that which if one fails to perform any of them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid because of his abandoning it. The requirements are that which if one fails to perform any of them intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid due to his abandoning it, but if he leaves any of them due to forgetfulness, he is obligated to perform the (extra) prostrations for forgetfulness.

The translator has provided a quick reference guide as an appendix listing each of these points, as well as footnotes with hadeeth references and other comments gathered from several sources of this treatise.
