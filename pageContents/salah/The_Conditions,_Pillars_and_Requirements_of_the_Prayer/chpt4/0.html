<p>Its requirements are eight:</p>
<ol>
    <li>All of the Takbeers except for the Opening Takbeer</li>
    <li>Saying "سُبْـحانَ رَبِّـيَ الْعَظـيم" [Perfect is my Lord, the Most Great] while bowing</li>
    <li>
        Saying "سَمِـعَ اللهُ لِمَـنْ حَمِـدَه" [Allaah hears the one who praises Him] – this applies to the one leading the prayer and the one praying alone
    </li>
    <li>Saying "رَبَّنـا وَلَكَ الحَمْـدُ" [Our Lord to You belongs the Praise] – this applies to everyone</li>
    <li>Saying "سُبْـحانَ رَبِّـيَ الأَعْلـى" [Perfect is my Lord, the Most High] while prostrating</li>
    <li>Saying "رَبِّ اغْفِـرْ لي" [My Lord, forgive me] while in between the two prostrations</li>
    <li>The first Tashahhud; and</li>
    <li>Sitting for it</li>
</ol>

    The pillars are that which if one fails to perform any of them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid because of his abandoning it. The requirements are that which if one fails to perform any of them intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid due to his abandoning it, but if he leaves any of them due to forgetfulness, he is obligated to perform the (extra) prostrations for forgetfulness (at the end of the prayer). And Allaah knows best.
