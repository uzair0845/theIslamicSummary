    Dukhool-ul-Waqt (Entrance of the Proper Time): The proof for this from the Sunnah is the hadeeth of Jibreel, peace be on him, when he lead the Prophet pbuh in one prayer during the initial times for it and during the last part of the hour of it, saying to him afterward:
</p>
<p class="quote">O Muhammad, the prayer is between these two times.<sup></sup></p>
<p>And also Allaah's statement:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="4:103">إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَٰبًۭا مَّوْقُوتًۭا</p>
<p class="quote">Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.</p>
<p>The proof that the prayers are in fixed times is Allaah's saying:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="17:78"></p>
<p class="quote">
    Establish the prayer from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e. Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Ishaa), and recite the Qur'aan in the early dawn (i.e. Fajr). Verily, the recitation of the Qur'aan in the early dawn is ever witnessed (by the angels).
