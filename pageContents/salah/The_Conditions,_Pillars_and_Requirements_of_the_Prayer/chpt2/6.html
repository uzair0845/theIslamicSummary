    Sitr-ul-'Awrah (Covering the 'Awrah): The People of Knowledge have unanimously agreed that the prayer of one who prays naked while having the ability (to clothe himself) is invalid. The boundaries of the 'awrah for a man are from his navel to his knees,<sup></sup> and the same applies to a female slave. As for a free woman, all of her body is 'awrah except for her face.<sup></sup> The proof for this is Allaah's saying:

    O Children of Aadam, take your adornment (by covering yourselves with clean clothes) when praying

            Translator's Note: A man must cover his shoulders in prayer as well, based on the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu 'anhu) in which the Prophet pbuh said:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            None of you should pray in a single garment with no part of it being over his shoulders

        Translator's Note: In prayer, a woman must cover her whole body, with the exception of her face and hands. Her dress must also be wide enough to cover the upper part of her feet Refer to Ibn Taimiyyah's book on the Woman's Dress in Prayer (Hijaab-ul-Mar'ah wa Libaasuhaa fis-Salaat), for a detailed discussion on the limits of what a man and woman must cover while in prayer.
