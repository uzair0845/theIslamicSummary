    Raf'-ul-Hadath (Uplifting Ritual Impurity): This refers to the ablution (wudoo) that is well known. What makes ablution mandatory is hadath (ritual impurities). Its conditions (shuroot) are ten:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Islaam</li>
    <li>Sanity</li>
    <li>Age of Maturity</li>
    <li>Intention</li>
    <li>
        Accompanying its ruling by the fact that one must intend to not stop it until he completes his ritual purity
    </li>
    <li>Removal of what makes ritual purity mandatory</li>
    <li>Cleansing the private parts</li>
    <li>Clean Water that is permissible to use</li>
    <li>Removing all things that prevent the water from reaching the skin</li>
    <li>It must be the proper time for it</li>
</ol>
<p>
    This applies to those who have a constant state of ritual impurity (i.e. such as menstruating women), due to its obligation.
</p>

<p>As for its obligations (furood), then they are six:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Washing the face, which includes Madmadah (rinsing the mouth) and Istinshaaq (inhaling water in the nose), and its boundaries are from where the hair of the head begins to the chin, lengthwise, and from the right ear to the left ear, widthwise
    </li>
    <li>Washing the hands up to (and including) the elbows</li>
    <li>Wiping the entire head, which includes the ears (with water)</li>
    <li>Washing the feet up to (and including) the ankles</li>
    <li>Maintaining this sequence</li>
    <li>Muwaalaat<sup></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The proof for this is Allaah's saying:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="5:6">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    O you who believe! When you rise to pray, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows. Wipe your heads (with water), and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.
</p>
<p>The proof for maintaining the same sequence (when performing wudoo) is the hadeeth:</p>
<p class="quote">Begin with what Allaah has began with.<sup></sup></p>
<p>
    The proof for Muwaalaat is the hadeeth of the man who left a spot unwashed. It was reported that one time the Prophet pbuh saw a man who had left a spot on his foot the size of a dirham, which water had not touched (when performing wudoo). So he pbuh ordered him to go back and repeat it.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Its requirement (waajib) is the tasmeeyah (mentioning Allaah's Name) along with the words of remembrance (dhikr).
</p>

<p>The things that nullify (nawaaqid) the ablution are eight:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Whatever comes out from the two private parts</li>
    <li>Any foul impure substance that comes out from the body</li>
    <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
    <li>Touching a woman with sexual desire</li>
    <li>Touching one's private part with the hand, whether it is the frontal or rear</li>
    <li>Eating the meat of camels</li>
    <li>Bathing a deceased person</li>
    <li>Apostating from Islaam, may Allaah protect us from that!</li>
</ol>

        Translator's Note: Muwaalat refers to when all of the acts of wudoo are done in order without any pause in between them so as to let the previous part of the body that was washed become dry.

        <div>Ibn 'Umar reported from Abu Bakr and 'Umar that they said:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            A man who had made the ablution once came, and he had a spot the size of a thumb on the top of his feet that wasn't washed, so the Prophet told him, "Go back and complete your ablution." So he did it.
