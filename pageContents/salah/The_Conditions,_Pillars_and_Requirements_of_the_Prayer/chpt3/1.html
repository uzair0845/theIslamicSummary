<h4>Standing, if one has the ability to do so</h4>

<p>Standing if one is able to do so. The proof for this is Allaah's statement:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:238"></p>
<p class="quote">
    Guard strictly the prayers, especially the middle one. And stand before Allaah with full submission.
</p>
<h4>The opening Takbeer</h4>
<p>The proof for this is the hadeeth:</p>
<p class="quote">
    Its opening<sup></sup> is the Takbeer (saying Allaahu Akbar) and its closing<sup></sup> is the Tasleem (Saying As-Salaam 'Alaikum).<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>After this occurs the opening supplication, which is supererogatory, and goes:</p>
<p class="arabic">سُبْحانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، وَتَبارَكَ اسْمُكَ، وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ، وَلاَ إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ</p>
<p class="quote">
    Free from imperfections are You, O Allaah, and all praise is Yours. Blessed is Your Name and there is no deity worthy of worship besides You.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The meaning of «سُبْحانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ» is: I absolve You from all imperfections in a manner that befits Your majesty.
    </li>
    <li>«وَبِحَمْدِكَ» i.e. while praising You.</li>
    <li>«وَتَبارَكَ اسْمُكَ» i.e. blessing can be attained by mentioning You.</li>
    <li>«وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ» i.e. Glorified be Your Greatness.</li>
    <li>
        «وَلاَ إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ» i.e. There is nothing that has the right to be worshipped on the earth or in the heaven except You, O Allaah.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Then he says:</p>
<p class="arabic">أعوذُ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ</p>
<p class="quote">I seek refuge in Allaah from the rejected devil.</p>
<ul>
    <li>«أعوذُ» means I seek refuge and recourse in You and rely on You, O Allaah.</li>
    <li>
        «بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ» means the outcast, the one who is far removed from Allaah's mercy. He cannot harm me in my religion or in my worldly affairs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah</h4>

<p class='arabic'>لاَ صَلاَةَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَقْرَأْ بِفَاتِحَةِ الْكِتَابِ</p>
<p class='quote'>There is no prayer for the one who doesn't recite the opening (chapter) of the Book.<sup></sup></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        «Bismillaah-ir-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem» (In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy) is a request for blessing and assistance.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Al-Hamdulillaah» (All praise is for Allaah): "Hamd" means praise. The definite article (Al) before Hamd is for including all the commendable acts He does. As for the good thing that one has no role in bringing about, such as beauty and so on, then praising that is called madah and not hamd.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Rabb-il-'Aalameen» (Lord of all that is created): Rabb means the One who is worshipped, the Creator, the Sustainer, the King, the One who administers and brings up all of the creation through His favors. With regard to 'Aalameen, everything that is apart from Allaah then that is considered 'Aalam. He is the Lord of everyone and everything.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Ar-Rahmaan» (The Most Merciful): means He grants a general mercy for all of the created beings.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Ar-Raheem» (The Bestower of Mercy): means He gives a specified mercy for just the believers.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Maaliki-Yawm-id-Deen» (Master of the Day of Judgement): refers to the Day of Reward, Recompense and Accountability, the Day when everyone will be compensated for his deeds – if they are good, then there will be good (for him) and if they were evil, then there will be evil (for him). 
    </li>
    <li>
        «Iyyaaka Na'budu» (You alone do we worship): meaning we don't worship anyone except You. This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not worship anyone besides Him.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Wa Iyyaaka Nasta'een» (And in You alone do we seek assistance): This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not seek the assistance of anyone besides Allaah.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem» (Guide us to the Straight Path) means direct us, show us the way and keep us firm on as-Siraat (the Path), meaning Islaam. It is also believed that it refers to the Messenger and likewise that it refers the Qur'aan. All of these meanings are true. What is meant by Mustaqeem (Straight) is that which has no deviations in it.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Siraat-aladheena An'amta 'alayhim» (The Path of those You bestowed Your Favor on): meaning the way of those who have received your Bounty.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Ghayr-il-Maghdoobi 'alayhim» (Not those who earned Your Anger): They are the Jews since they have knowledge but do not act on it. We ask Allaah to protect you from their way.
    </li>
    <li>
        «Wa laad-Daalleen» {Nor of those who went astray): This refers to the Christians, who worship Allaah based on ignorance and misguidance. We ask Allaah to protect you from their way.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4> The Final Tashahhud And Sitting For It</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The meaning of «التَّحِيَّاتُ» is that all of the glorifications are for Allaah, who possesses and deserves that, such as the acts of inclining, bowing, prostrating, remaining and continuing (in the acts of prayer). Everything for which the Lord of creation is glorified due to, then that belongs to Allaah. So whoever directs any part of that (glorification) to other than Allaah, he is a polytheist, disbeliever.
    </li>
    <li>«الصَّلَوَاتُ» means all of the supplications. It is also held that it refers to the five daily prayers.</li>
    <li>
        «وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ»: Allaah is Tayyib (good), He does not accept any of the sayings or actions except for those that are tayyib (good).
    </li>
    <li>
        «السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ» means that you are supplicating for the Prophet to have safety, mercy and blessing. The one who is supplicated for is not being supplicated to along with Allaah.<sup></sup>
    </li>
    <li>
        «السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللَّهِ الصَّالِحِينَ» means you are sending Salaam (peace) upon yourself and to every righteous servant in the heaven and the earth.
    </li>
    <li>
        «سلاَم» is for the supplication.
    </li>
    <li>
        «صالِحِينَ» is for those who are being supplicated for, and they are not being supplicated to along with Allaah.
    </li>
    <li>
        «أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ‏»: You testify with a certain testimony that no one in the heaven and the earth has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. And your testimony that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah means that he is a slave (worshipper of Allaah) who is not to be worshipped, and a messenger who is not to be rejected. Rather, he is to be obeyed and followed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sending Salaat on the Prophet and the (final) two Tasleems</h4>

<p class="arabic">ٱللَّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ</p>
<p>
    The meaning of Salaat from Allaah is His praising of His servant in the greatest of gatherings, as has been reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Abul-'Aaliyah who said: "The Salaat of Allaah means His praise for His servant in the highest of gatherings (i.e. angels)." It is also held that Salaat means mercy. But the first definition is more correct. As for the Salaat when it comes from the angels, then it means: Asking for forgiveness. And from the humans, it means supplication. Asking for blessing of Muhammad and what comes after that are all supererogatory statements and actions.

        Translator's Note: The word used in the hadeeth is «Tahreem», which has been translated as opening, but which more specifically means that which makes something forbidden. This is since with the opening Takbeer, the common actions of speaking and eating become forbidden, as one is now in prayer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Translator's Note: The word used in the hadeeth is «Tahleel», which has been translated as closing, but which more specifically means to make something permissible. This is since with the closing Takbeer, the common actions of speaking and eating become permitted again, as one is now out of prayer.

        Translator's Note: According to the hadeeth of Ibn Mas'ood (radyAllaahu 'anhu) reported in Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, the Companions would say: السَّلاَمُ‏ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ instead of لسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ after the Prophet pbuh died, mentioning him (sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) in the third person.
