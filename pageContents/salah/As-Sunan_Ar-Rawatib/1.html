<h4>The Importance of the Sunnah of Fajr Prayer</h4>
<p> From Ayesha (RA) who said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Prophet pbuh was not more concerned and did not pay attention to any of the optional prayers like he did for the two Rakat of Sunnah for the Fajr prayer.<sup></sup></p>
<p>From Ayesha ra from the Prophet pbuh who said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Two Rakat for Sunnah of Fajr prayer are better than the Dunyaa and everything that is in it.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Shortening the Sunnah of the Fajr Prayer</h4>
<p>From Ayesha ra who said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Messenger of Allaah pbuh used to pray two shortened Rakah which were before the morning (Fajr) prayer, he would shorten them so much that I would say: Did he recite Soorah Fatiha?<sup></sup></p>

<h4>What the Messenger pbuh would Recite in the Two Rakah for the Sunnah of the Fajr Prayer</h4>
<p>From Ibn Umar that the Prophet pbuh used to recite in the two Rakat for Fajr, and two Rakat after Maghrib prayer: "Say to these O Al-Kafiroon" & "Say: He is Allaah, (the) One."<sup></sup></p>

<p>Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p class='quote'>What is established from these Ahadeeth is that the Prophet pbuh sometimes would recite "Say to these O Al-Kafiroon" in the first Rakah, and "Say: He is Allaah, (the) One." in the second Rakah.</p>
<p class="quote">And sometimes he would read in the first of the two Rakah: "Say: We believe in Allaah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibraheem, Isma'eel, Ishaaq, Ya'qoob, and to Al-Asbaat [the twelve sons of Ya'qoob], and that which has been given to Moosa and Iesa, and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islaam)." [2:136]
</p>
<p class="quote">and in the second of the two Rakah: "Then when Iesa came to know of their disbelief, he said: 'Who will be my helpers in Allaah's Cause?' Al-Hawarioon (the disciples) said: 'We are the helpers of Allaah; we believe in Allaah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allaah).' Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger ['Iesa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. L창 il창ha illAll창h - none has the right to be worshipped but All창h)." [3:52-53]</p>
<p class="quote">And sometimes recite in the first of the two Rakah: "Say: We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us," [2:136] and in the second of the two Rakah: "Say: 'O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.'" [3:64].</p>
<p class="quote">And sometimes he would recite in the first of the two Rakah: "Say: 'We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibraheem, Isma'eel, Ishaaq, Ya'qoob and Al-Asbaat [the twelve sons of Ya'qoob] and what was given to Moosa, Iesa and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between one another among them and to Him (Allaah) we have submitted (in Islaam).'" [3:83]</p>
<p class="quote">and in the second Rakah: "Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger ['Iesa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. La ilaha ill-Allaah - none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)." [3:53] or with this Ayaah: "Verily, We have sent you with the truth (Islaam), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, they will enter the Hell-fire). And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire." [2:119]</p>

<h4>Recommendation to Pray the Two Rakah at Home</h4>
<p>Abu Tayeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p class='quote'>It is better to pray the two Rakah at home, because the optional pray at home is of a more complete status and has more reward than praying it in the Masjid. This is affirmed from the Prophet pbuh from his actions and his statements.</p>
<p>Imam Nawawi said in the explanation of Muslim:</p>
<p class='quote'>Indeed one is encouraged to pray optional prayer in the home due to it being more hidden away, further away from showing off, more protective from being cancelled out and that the home can get blessings, and that mercy can descend in the home, and the Angels, and that the Shaytaan runs away.</p>

<h4>Lying down on the Right Hand side after the Two Rakah Sunnah of the Fajr</h4>
<p>The Hadeeth of Ayesha, collected by Bukhari that she said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Prophet pbuh used to lie down on his right side after praying two Rakats [Sunnah] of Fajr.</p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p class='quote'>This is a clear proof of the permissibility of laying down between the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer and the obligatory prayer, however, it is not known that anyone from the Companions did so in the Masjid, but rather some of them disliked and criticized this. Therefore, it should be limited to what the Prophet did in his house as is his pbuh Sunnah.<sup></sup></p>
<p>It has been collected by Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Dawood from Ayesha who said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Prophet pbuh used to, once he had prayed the two Rakah of the Sunnah for the Fajr, he would talk to me if I were awake, otherwise he would lie down.</p>

<h4>The Dislike of Praying the Optional Prayer once Fajr Time has come in, other than the Two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr Prayer</h4>
<p>Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p class='quote'>It is disliked to pray the optional prayer after Fajr time has come in, because the Prophet pbuh did not pray more than the two Rakah of the Sunnah even though he had great concern over the prayer. Yet there is a prohibition from the Prophet pbuh against this.</p>

<h4>The Dislike for the Worshipper to begin Praying Two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr After the Muadhin began the Iqama for the prayer</h4>
<p>The Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class='quote'>If the prayer is established then there is no prayer except for the obligatory one.</p>
<p>Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi discusses the general times that prayer is prohibited:</p>
<p class='quote'>Five types, the prohibition to pray after Fajr and Asr, at the time of sunrise, at sunset, and when the sun has reached its highest point, and every one of these types has exceptions. So we say: from the specific times out of the general times is the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah which was collected by Bukhari in the 'Chapter: Whoever catches one Rakah from the Asr prayer before sunset.'</p>

<h4> Praying two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr Prayer after the Obligatory Prayer if You Cannot Pray Before it</h4>
<p>From Abu Hurairah ra who said the Messenger of Allaah pbuh said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Whoever did not pray the two Rakah [Sunnah] of Fajr; then he should pray them after the sun has risen.<sup></sup><sup></sup></p>
