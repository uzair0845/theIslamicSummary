<p>Then he (pbuh) would commence the prayer by saying: Allaah is the Greatest<sup></sup></p>
<p>He would also used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>The key to the prayer is purification, it is entered by takbeer and exited by tasleem.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Also, he used to raise his voice for the takbeer such that those behind him could hear.<sup></sup> But, when he fell ill Abu Bakr used to raise his voice to convey the takbeer of the Messenger (pbuh) to the people<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>He would also say:</p>
<p class='quote'>When the Imaam says: Allaahu Akbar, then say: Allaahu Akbar.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Raising The Hands</h4>
<p>He would raise his hands sometimes with the takbeer<sup></sup>, sometimes after the takbeer<sup></sup>, and sometimes before it<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>"He would raise them with fingers apart [not spaced out, nor together]"<sup></sup>, and "he would put them level with his shoulders"<sup></sup>, although occasionally, "he would raise them until they were level with [the tops of] his ears."<sup></sup></p>

<h4>To Place The Right Arm On The Left Arm, And The Command For It</h4>
<p>He pbuh used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>We, the company of prophets, have been commanded to hasten the breaking of the fast, to delay the meal before the fast, and to place our right arms on our left arms during prayer.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Also "he passed by a man who was praying and had placed his left arm on his right, so he pulled them apart and placed the right on the left."<sup></sup></p>

<h4>To Place The Hands On The Chest</h4>
<p>"He used to place the right arm on the back of his left palm, wrist and forearm"<sup></sup>, and (sometimes) "he would grasp his left arm with his right."<sup></sup></p>
<p>"He used to place them on his chest."<sup></sup></p>
<p>Also "he used to forbid putting one's hand on the waist during prayer [and he put his hand on his waist (to demonstrate)]"<sup></sup>. And this is the "silb" which he used to forbid<sup></sup>.</p>

As for the combination of holding and placing, which some of the later Hanafees hold to be good, then that is an innovation; its form as they state is to place the right hand on the left, holding the wrist with the little finger and the thumb, and laying flat the remaining three fingers.</li>

            To place them on the chest is what is proved in the Sunnah, and all that is contrary to it is either da`eef or totally baseless.
