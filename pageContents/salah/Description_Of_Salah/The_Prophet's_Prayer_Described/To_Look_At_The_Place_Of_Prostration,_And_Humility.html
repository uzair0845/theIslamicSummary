    "He pbuh used to incline his head during prayer and fix his sight towards the ground"<sup></sup> - "while he was in the Ka'bah, his sight did not leave the place of his prostration until he came out from it"<sup></sup>
</p> 
<p>
    "He used to forbid looking up at the sky" <sup></sup>. In another hadeeth:
</p>
<p class='quote'>So when you pray, do not look here and there, for Allaah sets His Face for the face of his slave in his prayer as long as he does not look away<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>He also said about looking here and there:</p>
<p class='quote'>It is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He pbuh also said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Allaah does not cease to turn to a slave in his prayer as long as he is not looking around; when he turns his face away, Allaah turns away from him.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He "forbade three things: pecking like a hen, squatting (iq'aa') like a dog and looking around like a fox"<sup></sup>.</p>
 
<p>He also used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>Any person who, when an obligatory prayer is due, excels in its ablution, humility and bowings, will have it as a remission for his previous minor sins as long as he does not commit a major sin, and this (opportunity) is for all times.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Once he pbuh, prayed in a khameesah<sup></sup> and (during the prayer) he looked at its marks. So when he finished, he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Take this khameesah of mine to Abu Jahm and bring me his anbijaaniyyah<sup></sup>, for it has diverted my attention from the prayer (in one narration: for I have looked at its marks during the prayer and it almost put me to trial)<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>Also "Aaishah had a cloth with pictures spread towards a sahwah<sup></sup>, towards which the Prophet pbuh prayed and then said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Take it away from me [for its pictures did not cease to thwart me in my prayer].<sup></sup></p>
<p>He would also say:</p>
<p class='quote'>Prayer is not valid when the food has been served, nor when it is time to relieve oneself of the two filths.<sup></sup></p>

        <div>Al-Bayhaqee and al-Haakim, who declared it saheeh and it is as he said. It also has a strengthening hadeeth reported by ten of his Companions: transmitted by Ibn `Asaakir (17/202/2). See Irwaa' (354).</div>
        <div>
            These two ahaadeeth show that the sunnah is to fix one's sight on the place of prostration on the ground, so the action of some worshippers of closing their eyes during Prayer is misdirected piety, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad pbuh.

The Messenger pbuh did not order the wiping out or tearing of the pictures but only removed them because - and Allaah knows best - they were not pictures of things having souls.
