<p>Next, he pbuh would seek refuge with Allaah the Exalted, saying:</p>
<p class='arabic'>أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ</p>
<p class='quote'>I seek refuge with Allah from the Evil One, the Rejected, from his madness<sup></sup>, his arrogance, and his poetry.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes he pbuh would add to this, saying:</p>
<p class='arabic'>أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ...</p>
<p class='quote'>I seek refuge with Allah, the all-Hearing, the all-Knowing, from the Evil One...<sup></sup></p>
<p>Then he pbuh would recite:</p>
<p class='arabic'>بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p class='quote'>In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</p>
<p>but not loudly.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Recitation Of One Verse At A Time</h4>
<p>Next, he would recite Soorah al-Faatihah and divide his recitation, reciting one verse at a time. He would say:</p>
<p class='arabic'>بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>Here he would pause, and then say:</p>
<p class='arabic'>الْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p>
<p>Then he would pause, and then say:</p>
<p class='arabic'>الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>Then he would pause, and then say:</p>
<p class='arabic'>مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p>... and so on, until the end of the Soorah. The rest of his recitation was also like this: stopping at the end of the verse and not joining it with the one after.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes, he would recite:</p>
<p class='arabic'>مَلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p class='quote'>King of the Day of Judgment</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p class='arabic'>مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p class='quote'>Master of the Day of Judgment<sup></sup></p>

<h4>The Necessity Of Al-Faatihah, And Its Excellence</h4>

<p>He would vehemently emphasise the importance of this soorah, saying:</p>
<p class='quote'>There is no prayer for the one who did not recite [in it] the opening chapter [at least].<sup></sup></p>

<h4>The Abrogation Of Recitation Behind The Imaam In The Loud Prayer</h4>
<p>He had given permission for those being led by the Imaam to recite Soorah al-Faatihah in the loud prayers, when once:</p>
<p class='quote'>He was praying Fajr and the recitation became difficult for him. When he finished, he said: "Perhaps you recite behind your imaam." We said: "Yes, quickly<sup></sup>, O Messenger of Allaah." He said: "Do not do so, except for [each of you reciting] the opening chapter of the Book, for the prayer is not valid of the one who does not recite it."<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>Later, he forbade them from reciting in the loud prayers at all, when:</p>
<p class='quote'>"He finished a prayer in which he was reciting loudly (in one narration: it was the dawn prayer) and said: "Were any of you reciting with me just now?!" A man said: "Yes, I was, O Messenger of Allaah". He said: "I say, why am I contended with?" [Abu Hurayrah said:] So the people stopped reciting with the Messenger of Allaah pbuh when he was reciting loudly after hearing that from him [but they recited to themselves quietly when the imaam was not reciting loudly]."<sup></sup></p>
<p>He also made silence during the imaam's recitation part of the completeness of following the imaam, saying:</p>
<p class='quote'>The imaam is there to be followed, so when he says takbeer, say takbeer, and when he recites, be silent<sup></sup>, just as he made listening to the imaam's recitation enough to not have to recite behind him, saying: He who has an imaam, then the recitation of the imaam is recitation for him.<sup></sup></p>
<p> - this applying in the loud prayers.</p>

<h4>The Obligation To Recite In The Quiet Prayers</h4>
<p>As for the quiet prayers, he urged them to recite during them; Jaabir said:</p>
<p class='quote'>We used to recite behind the imaam in Zuhr and 'Asr: Soorah al-Faatihah and another Soorah in the first two rak'ahs, and Soorah al-Faatihah in the last two.<sup></sup></p>
<p>However, he dissuaded them from confusing him with their recitation, when:</p>
<p class='quote'>He prayed Zuhr with his Companions and said (afterwards): "Which of you recited {Glorify the name of your Lord the Most High} (Soorah al-A'laa, 87)?" Someone said: "It was I [but I was only intending nothing but good by doing so]." So he said: "I knew that someone was contending with me by it."<sup></sup></p>
<p>In another hadeeth:</p>
<p class='quote'>They used to recite behind the Prophet pbuh [loudly], so he said: "You have mixed up my (recitation of the) Qur.aan."<sup></sup></p>

<h4>The Aameen, And The Imaam's Saying It Loudly</h4>
<p>When he pbuh finished reciting al-Faatihah, he would say:</p>
<p class='arabic'>آمين</p>
<p class='quote'>aameen</p>
<p>loudly, prolonging his voice.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He also used to order the congregation to say aameen:</p>
<p class='quote'>When the imaam says,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse="1:7">غَيْرِ ٱلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>"Not of those who receive (Your) anger, nor of those who go astray", then say "aameen" [for the angels say "aameen" and the imaam says aameen"] (in another narration: when the imaam says "aameen" say "aameen"), so he whose aameen coincides with the aameen of the angels (in another narration: when one of you says "aameen" in prayer and the angels in the sky say "aameen", and they coincide), his past sins are forgiven.»<sup></sup></p>
<p>In another hadeeth:</p>
<p class='quote'>...then say aameen; Allaah will answer you.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>The Recitation After Al-Faatihah</h4>
<p>Next, he pbuh would recite another Soorah after al-Faatihah, making it long sometimes, and on other occasions making it short because of travel, cough, illness or the crying of infants.</p>
<p>Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: "He pbuh made it [i.e. the recitation] short one day in the dawn prayer." (In another hadeeth: he prayed the morning prayer and recited the two shortest soorahs in the Qur.aan.) So it was said: "O Messenger of Allaah, why did you make it short?" He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>I heard the crying of a child, and I supposed that his mother was praying with us, so I wanted to free his mother for him.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>Give every Soorah its share of rukoo' and sujood.<sup></sup></p>
<p>In another narration:</p>
<p class='quote'> Every Soorah should have a rak'ah.<sup></sup></p>
<p>One of the Ansaar used to lead them in the mosque of Qubaa', and every time he recited a Soorah for them, he would begin with "Say: He is Allaah, the One and Only " (Soorah al-Ikhlaas, 112) until its end, and then recite another Soorah with it, and he would do this in every rak'ah. Because of this, his people spoke to him, saying:</p>
<p class='quote'>You begin with this soorah, and then you do not regard it as enough until you recite another one: you should either recite it (only) or leave it and recite another one.</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>I will not leave it: if you do not mind me leading you with it, I shall carry on, but if you do not like it, I shall leave you.</p>
<p>They knew that he was one of their best, and they did not like to be led by anyone else, so when the Prophet pbuh came to them, they told him the story. He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>O so- and-so, what stops you from doing what your people ask you to? What makes you recite this Soorah in every rak'ah?</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>I love this soorah.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Your love for it will enter you into the Garden.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Combining Similar Soorahs And Others In One Rak'ah</h4>
<p>He used to combine the pairs<sup></sup> of the mufassal<sup></sup> soorahs, so he used to recite one of the following pairs of soorahs in one rak'ah<sup></sup>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ar-Rahmaan (55:78) and an-Najm (53:62);</li>
    <li>al-Qamar (54:55) and al-Haaqqah (69:52);</li>
    <li>at-Toor (52:49) and Dhaariyaat (51:60);</li>
    <li>al-Waaqi'ah (56:96) and al-Qalam (68:52);</li>
    <li>al-Ma'aarij (70:44) and an-Naazi'aat (79:46);</li>
    <li>al-Mutaffifeen (83:36) and 'Abasa (80:42);</li>
    <li>al-Muddaththir (74:56) and al-Muzzammil (73:20);</li>
    <li>ad-Dahr (76:31) and al-Qiyaamah (75:40);</li>
    <li>an-Naba (78:40) and al-Mursalaat (77:50);</li>
    <li>ad-Dukhaan (44:59) and at-Takweer (81:29).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes he would combine soorahs from the seven tiwaal (long soorahs), such as al-Baqarah, an-Nisaa' and aal-Imraan in one rak'ah during night prayer (below). He used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>The most excellent prayer is one with long standing.<sup></sup></p>

            The three Arabic words hamz, nafkh, and nafth, were interpreted such by the narrator; all three interpretations are also traced back to the Prophet pbuh with a saheeh mursal isnaad. By "poetry" here is meant the vain kind, for the Prophet pbuh said:

    <li>Abu Daawood and at-Tirmidhee with a hasan isnaad. Ahmad endorsed it (Masaa.il of Ibn Haanee 1/50).</li>
    <li>Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Abu Awaanah, at-Tahaawee and Ahmad.</li>
    <li>Abu Daawood and Sahmee (64 -65); al-Haakim declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed. It is given in Irwaa' (343). Abu Amr ad-Daani transmitted it al-Muktafaa (5/2) and said: "This hadeeth has many routes, and it is what is depended upon in this regard, and several of the past imaams and reciters preferred to stop at every verse, even if some were connected (in meaning) to the one after." I say: This is a sunnah which has been neglected by the majority of the reciters of this age, let alone others.</li>
    <li>Tammaam ar-Raazee in al-Fawaa.id, Ibn Abee Dawood in al-Masaahif (7/2), Abu Nuaym in Akhbaar Isbahaan (1/104) and al-Haakim who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed. Both of these recitations are mutawaatir.</li>

    <li>Maalik, Humaydee, al-Bukhaaree in his pamphlet, Abu Daawood and Mahaamalee (6/[139/1). at-Tirmidhee declared it hasan; Abu Haatim ar-Raazee, Ibn Hibbaan and Ibn Qayyim declared it saheeh.</li>
    <li>Ibn Abee Shaybah (1/97/1), Abu Daawood, Muslim, Abu Awaanah and Ruwayaanee in his musnad (24/119/1). It is given in Irwaa' (332, 394).</li>
    <li>Ibn Abee Shaybah (1/97/1), ad-Daaraqutnee, Ibn Maajah, at-Tahaawee and Ahmad from numerous routes, musnad and mursal. Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah declared it strong, as in al-Furoo` of Ibn `Abdul Haadee (48/2). Boosayree declared some of its isnaads saheeh. I have discussed it in detail and investigated its routes of narration inthe manuscript version and then in Irwaa' al-Ghaleel (no. 500).</li>
    <li>Ibn Maajah with a saheeh isnaad. It is given in Irwaa' (506)</li>
    <li>Muslim, Abu Awaanah and Siraaj.</li>
    <li>Al-Bukhaaree in his article, Ahmad and Siraaj with a hasan isnaad.</li>

    <li>
        <div>Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, an-Nasaa.ee, and ad-Daarimee; the additional wordings are reported by the latter two, and prove that this hadeeth cannot justify that the imaam does not say aameen, as reported from Maalik; hence, Ibn Hajar says in Fat.hul-Baaree:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">It clearly shows that the imaam says aameen.</div>
        <div>Ibn Abdul Barr says in Tamheed (7/[13):</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">It is the view of the majority of the Muslims, including Maalik as the people of Madeenah report from him, for it is authentic from Allaah's Messenger pbuh through the ahaadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (i.e. this one) and that of Waail ibn Hujr (i.e. the previous one).</div>
    </li>
    <li>Muslim and Abu Awaanah.</li>
    <li>Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad; the other hadeeth was transmitted by Ibn Abee Dawood in al-Masaahif (4/14/2). This and other similar hadeeths contain permission for infants to enter the mosque. As for the hadeeth on many lips: "Keep your small children away from your mosques...", it is da'eef and cannot be used for proof at all;</li>
    <li>Ibn Abee Shaybah (1/100/1), Ahmad and 'Abdul Ghanee al-Maqdisee in his Sunan (9/2) with a saheeh isnaad.</li>
    <li>Ibn Nasr and at-Tahaawee with a saheeh isnaad;</li>
    <li>al-Bukhaaree as ta'leeq and at-Tirmidhee as mawsool, and he declared it saheeh.</li>
    <li>nazaa'ir: soorahs which are similar in meaning, e.g. they both contain advice, commandments, or stories.</li>
    <li>These are agreed to end at the end of the Qur.aan; the soundest view is that they begin with Soorah Qaaf (no. 50).</li>
    <li>Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</li>
    <li>Muslim and at-Tahaawee.</li>
