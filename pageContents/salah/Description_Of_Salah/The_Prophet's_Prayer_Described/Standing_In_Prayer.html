<p>He (pbuh) used to stand in prayer for both obligatory and voluntary prayers, carrying out the command of the Exalted:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:238'>وَقُومُوا۟ لِلَّهِ قَٰنِتِينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>And stand before Allaah devoutly</p>
<p>As for during a journey, he would pray voluntary prayers on his riding beast. He set the example for his ummah to pray during severe fear on foot or while mounted.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:238-239'></p>
<p class='quote'>Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the middle prayer<sup></sup>, and stand before Allaah devoutly. If you fear (an enemy) then pray on foot, or while riding. But when you are in security, celebrate Allaah's praises in the manner He has taught you, which you did not know before.</p>
<p>He (pbuh) prayed sitting during the illness of which he died.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He also prayed sitting on another occasion before that, when he was injured, and the people behind him prayed standing; so he indicated to them to sit, so they sat (and prayed). When he finished, he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>You were going to do as the Persians and the Romans do: stand for their kings who sit. So do not do so, for the Imaam is there to be followed: when he makes rukoo', make rukoo', when he rises, rise; and when he prays sitting, pray sitting [all of you].<sup></sup></p>
<h4>The Prayer Of A Sick Person In A Sitting Position</h4>
<p>Imran ibn Husayn ra said: I was suffering from haemorrhoids (piles), so I asked the Messenger of Allaah pbuh and he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Pray standing; if you are not able, then sitting down; if you are not able to do so, then pray lying down.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Imraan ibn Husayn also said: I asked him pbuh about the prayer of a man while sitting, so he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>He who prays standing, that is better; he who prays sitting, his reward is half that of the former. He who prays lying down (and in another narration: reclining), has half the reward of the one who sits.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Once he (pbuh) visited a sick person and saw him praying (leaning) on a pillow, so he took it and cast it aside. So the man took a stick to pray (leaning) on it, but he took it and cast it aside and said:</p>
<p class="quote">Pray on the ground if you can, but otherwise make movements with your head, making your sujood lower than your rukoo.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Prayer On A Ship</h4>
<p>He (pbuh) was asked about prayer on a ship, so he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Pray on it standing, unless you are afraid of drowning.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Sitting And Standing In The Night Prayer (Tahajjud)</h4>
<p>He (pbuh), used to pray long through the night standing, and long through the night sitting, and if he recited standing, he would bow standing, and if he recited sitting, he would bow sitting.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes, "He would pray sitting, so he would recite sitting until about thirty or forty verses of his recitation wre left; he would then stand up to recite these standing and then bow and prostrate, and he would do likewise in the second raka'ah."<sup></sup></p>
<p>In fact, "he prayed as-subhah<sup></sup> sitting down towards the end of his life when he had grown old, and that was a year before his death."<sup></sup></p>
<p>Also "he would sit cross-legged."<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Prayer Wearing Shoes And The Command To Do So</h4>
<p>He used to stand (in prayer) bare-footed sometimes and wearing shoes sometimes.<sup></sup></p>
<p>He encouraged prayer wearing them sometimes, saying:</p>
<p class="quote">Be different from the Jews, for they do not pray in their shoes nor in their khuffs (leather socks).<sup></sup></p>

<p>Abu Sa'eed al-Khudree has said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Messenger of Allaah (pbuh) prayed with us one day. Whilst he was engaged in the prayer he took off his shoes and placed them on his left. When the people saw this, they took off their shoes. When he finished his prayer he said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Why did you take your shoes off?</p>
<p class='quote'>They said: 'We saw you taking your shoes off, so we took our shoes off.' He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily Jibreel came to me and informed me that there was dirt - or he said: something harmful - (in another narration: filth) on my shoes, so I took them off. Therefore, when one of you goes to the mosque, he should look at his shoes: if he sees in them dirt - or he said: something harmful - (in another narration: filth) he should wipe them and pray in them<sup></sup></p>
<p>He pbuh would also say:</p>
<p class='quote'>When one of you prays, he should not place his shoes on his right nor on his left, where they will be on someone else's right, except if there is no one on his left, but he should place them between his feet.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Prayer On The Pulpit (Minbar)</h4>
<p>Once he pbuh prayed on the pulpit (in another narration: '...which had three steps').<sup></sup></p>
<p>Hence [he stood on it and said takbeer and the people behind him said takbeer while he was on the pulpit,] [then he made rukoo' on the pulpit,] then he rose and descended backwards to make sajdah at the foot of the pulpit. Then he returned, [and did on it as he had done in the first rak'ah], until he completed his prayer. He then turned to the people and said:</p>
<p class="quote">O people! I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>The Sutrah, And The Obligation To Have One</h4>
<p>He (pbuh) used to stand near to the sutrah, so that there was (a distance of) three cubits between him and the wall<sup></sup> and between the place of his prostration and the wall, (there was) enough space for a sheep to pass<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>He used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone pass in front of you, but if someone continues (to try to pass) then fight him, for he has a companion (i.e. a shaytaan) with him.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes he pbuh would to set his mount sideways and pray towards it<sup></sup>, but this is not the same as prayer in the resting-place of camels, which he forbade<sup></sup>. Sometimes he would pray towards the bed on which 'Aishah ra was lying [under her sheet]<sup></sup>.</p>
<p>He (pbuh), would not let anything pass between him and his sutrah, hence once he was praying, when a sheep came running in front of him, so he raced it until he pressed his belly against the wall [and it passed behind him].<sup></sup></p>
<p>He also used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>If the person who passed in front of someone praying knew (the sin) on him, it would be better for him to wait forty than to pass in front.</p>
<p>Abu an-Nadr said: "I do not remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years."<sup></sup></p>

<h4>What Breaks The Prayer</h4>
<p>He used to say:</p>
<p class='quote'>A man's prayer is cut off when there is nothing such as the end of a saddle in front of him, by: a [menstruating]<sup></sup> woman, a donkey or a black dog.</p>
<p>Abu Dharr said: 'I said: "O Messenger of Allaah, why the black dog rather than the red one?" He said:</p>
<p class="quote">The black dog is a shaytaan.<sup></sup></p>

<h4>Prohibition Of Prayer Facing The Grave</h4>
<p>He used to forbid prayer facing the grave, saying: Do not pray towards the graves, and do not sit on them.<sup></sup></p>
