<h3>The prohibition of backbiting and gossiping</h3>
<p>
    As for Backbiting (gheebah), then it is when you mention something about a person (in his absence), that he hates (to have mentioned). It is the same whether you mention that about him with words, through writings, or whether you point or indicate that by gesturing with your eyes, hand or head.
</p>
<p>
    Imaam Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee quoted the consensus of the Muslim scholars with regard to backbiting being: "One's mentioning something about other people (in their absence), which they hate to have mentioned."
</p>
<p>
    As for Gossiping (nameemah), then it is when one conveys and carries the talk of people from one group of individuals to another with the intent of causing discord between the two of them. 
</p>

<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="49:12">وَلَا يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضًا</p>
<p class="quote">And do not backbite one another</p>
<p>And He says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="104:1"></p>
<p class="quote">Woe to every slanderer and backbiter</p>

<p>Hudhayfah reported that the Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class="quote">The one who spreads gossip (Namaam) will not enter Paradise.<sup></sup></p>
<p>Abu Hurairah reported that Allaah's Messenger pbuh once said (to his Companions):</p>
<p class="quote">Do you know what backbiting is?</p>
<p>They said: "Allaah and His Messenger know best." He said:</p>
<p class="quote">
    Your mentioning something about your brother (in his absence) that he hates (to have mentioned).
</p>
<p>It was said: "What if there exists in my brother, that which I say (of him)?" He pbuh said:</p>
<p class="quote">
    If there is found in him what you say, then you have backbitten him. And if there is not found in him what you say, then you have slandered him.
</p>

<p>Anas reported that Allaah's Messenger pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">لَمَّا عُرِجَ بِي مَرَرْتُ بِقَوْمٍ لَهُمْ أَظْفَارٌ مِنْ نُحَاسٍ يَخْمِشُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَصُدُورَهُمْ فَقُلْتُ مَنْ هَؤُلاَءِ يَا جِبْرِيلُ قَالَ هَؤُلاَءِ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ لُحُومَ النَّاسِ وَيَقَعُونَ فِي أَعْرَاضِهِمْ</p>
<p class="quote">
    When I was ascended (to the heavens), I came across a people that had nails made of brass, with which they were scratching their faces and their chests. So I said: 'Who are these people, O Jibreel?' He said: 'They are the ones who eat the flesh of people21 and dishonor them.'<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>It is recorded in Muslim that:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏الْمُسْلِمُ أَخُو الْمُسْلِمِ لاَ يَظْلِمُهُ وَلاَ يَخْذُلُهُ وَلاَ يَحْقِرُهُ‏.‏ التَّقْوَى هَا هُنَا‏"‏.‏ وَيُشِيرُ إِلَى صَدْرِهِ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ ‏"بِحَسْبِ امْرِئٍ مِنَ الشَّرِّ أَنْ يَحْقِرَ أَخَاهُ الْمُسْلِمَ"
</p>
<p class="quote">
    Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger pbuh as saying: "A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The piety is here." He pointed towards his chest thrice. "It is a serious evil for a Muslim that he should look down upon his brother Muslim."<sup></sup>
