<h3>Expiating oneself and repenting from backbiting</h3>
<p>
    Know that it is required upon everyone that commits a sin to rush towards repenting from it. Repentance with regard to the rights of Allaah must meet three conditions: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>One must stop committing that sin immediately,</li>
    <li>He must feel remorse and sorrow for having done it</li>
    <li>He must resolve to not return to committing that sin again</li>
</ol>
<p>Repentance with regard to the rights of humans must also meet a fourth condition, which is:</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>
        Taking back any oppression that was inflicted on someone or asking for his forgiveness or absolvment from that.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    If the one who has been backbitten is either dead or absent, then one is excused from seeking to be absolved from it. However, the scholars say: He should supplicate much for that person and ask forgiveness for him, as well as do many good deeds.
</p>

<p>
    Know that it is preferable for the one who has been backbitten to absolve the backbiter from his sin, but it is not an obligation on him to do so. This is because it is giving away and forfeiting one's right, so the choice is his. However, it is strongly recommended for him to absolve him so that his Muslim brother can be free from the harm of this sin and so that he can be successful in receiving Allaah's great reward of Forgiveness and Love. Allaah, the Most High, says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="3:134">وَالْكَاظِمِينَ الْغَيْظَ وَالْعَافِينَ عَنِ النَّاسِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p>
<p class="quote">Those who repress their anger and pardon people. Verily, Allaah loves the good doers</p>

<p>
    The proper way he should take in making himself allow the pardoning is by reminding himself that: "This matter has already happened and there is no way to remove it now. So it is not right for me to make him miss his chance of getting reward and absolving my Muslim brother." Allah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="42:43"></p>
<p class="quote">
    And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives (others), that is truly from the things recommended by Allaah
</p>
<p>And in the authentic hadeeth, the Messenger of Allaah pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">وَاللَّهُ فِي عَوْنِ الْعَبْدِ مَا كَانَ الْعَبْدُ فِي عَوْنِ أَخِيهِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    And Allaah remains in the assistance of (His) servant so long as the servant remains in the assistance of his (fellow) brother.<sup></sup>
