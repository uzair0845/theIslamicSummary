<h3>The backbiting of the heart</h3>
<p>
    Know that having bad thoughts about someone is forbidden just like having bad speech about him. So just as it is forbidden for you to speak to others about the defects of a person, it is likewise forbidden for you to speak to yourself about that and to hold bad thoughts for him. Allaah says
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="49:12">
    يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ
</p>
<p class="quote">
    O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.
</p>
<p> Abu Hurairah pbuh reported that Allaah's Messenger pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظَّنَّ فَإِنَّ الظَّنَّ أَكْذَبُ الْحَدِيثِ</p>
<p class="quote">Avoid suspicion, for suspicion is the gravest lie in talk<sup></sup></p>

    The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one's mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur.

<p>The Messenger of Allaah pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">إِنَّ اللَّهَ تَجَاوَزَ لأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ يَتَكَلَّمُوا أَوْ يَعْمَلُوا بِهِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    Verily Allah forgave my people the evil promptings which arise within their hearts as long as they did not speak about them or did not act upon them.<sup></sup>
