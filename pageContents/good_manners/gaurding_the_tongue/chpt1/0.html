<h3>Guarding The Tongue</h3>
<p>
    Know that every individual who falls under the category of being responsible for his actions (mukallaf) must guard his tongue from all types of speech, except for that speech which consists predominantly of some benefit.
</p>
<p>
    In a situation where speaking and refraining from speech are both found to contain the same amount of benefit within them, then the Sunnah is to refrain from it, altogether. This is because the allowable speech (equal in benefit and harm) paves the way towards that which is forbidden as well as disliked. Rather, in most cases, this will be the result, and applying safety, at that point, will not be able to soothe it in the least. Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet PBUH said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">مَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الآخِرِ فَلْيَقُلْ خَيْرًا أَوْ لِيَصْمُتْ</p>
<p class="quote">Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day should speak good or remain silent<sup></sup></p>
<p>
    Imaam Ash-Shaafi'ee said: "When one desires to talk, then it is upon him to think before he speaks. If there is beneficial good in what he will say, then he should speak. And if he has doubt about that, then he
    must not speak until he clears that doubt (by making his speech good)."
</p>
<p>
    Abu Moosaa Al-Ash'aree reported: "I said: 'O Messenger of Allaah! Which of the Muslims is best?' He responded: 'He whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe from.'"<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Sahl bin Sa'ad reported that Allaah's Messenger PBUH said:</p>
<p class="arabic">مَنْ يَضْمَنْ لِي مَا بَيْنَ لَحْيَيْهِ وَمَا بَيْنَ رِجْلَيْهِ أَضْمَنْ لَهُ الْجَنَّةَ</p>
<p class="quote">
    Whoever can guarantee for me (that he will guard) what is between his jaws (tongue) and what is between his legs (private parts), I will guarantee for him Paradise.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    Abu Hurairah reported that he heard the Prophet PBUH say: "Indeed, the servant (of Allaah) will speak a word, while being unaware of (its consequences), and due to it, he will be cast into the Hellfire, farther than the distance between the east and the west."<sup></sup> In the narration of Al-Bukhaaree, there only occur the words: "farther than the distance between the west" without mentioning the east. The meaning of "while being unaware" is that he does not stop to consider whether his speech is good or not.
</p>

<p>
    'Uqbah bin 'Aamir reported: I said: 'O Messenger of Allaah, how does one attain salvation?' He pbuh responded:
</p>
<p class="arabic">أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ لِسَانَكَ وَلْيَسَعْكَ بَيْتُكَ وَابْكِ عَلَى خَطِيئَتِكَ</p>
<p class="quote">Restrain your tongue, remain in your home and weep over your sins<sup></sup></p>

<p>Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudree reported that the Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    إِذَا أَصْبَحَ ابْنُ آدَمَ فَإِنَّ الأَعْضَاءَ كُلَّهَا تُكَفِّرُ اللِّسَانَ فَتَقُولُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ فِينَا فَإِنَّمَا نَحْنُ بِكَ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَمْتَ اسْتَقَمْنَا وَإِنِ اعْوَجَجْتَ اعْوَجَجْنَا
</p>
<p class="quote">
    When the Son of Aadam wakes from his sleep, all of his body parts seek refuge from his tongue, saying: "Fear Allaah with regard to us, for indeed we are part of you. So if you are upright, then we will be upright and if you are corrupt, then we will be corrupt."<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    Mu'aadh bin Jabal reported: I said: "O Messenger of Allaah! Tell me of an act that will take me to Paradise and keep me away from the Hellfire." He said:
</p>
<p class="quote">
    You have asked me about a major matter. But it is easy for he whom Allaah, may He be Exalted, makes it easy for. You must worship Allaah, associating nothing with him. You must perform the prayers and pay the Zakaat. You must fast in Ramadaan and perform the Hajj to the House (Ka'abah).
</p>
<p>Then he pbuh said:</p>
<p class="quote">
    Shall I not show you the gates of goodness? Fasting is a shield; charity extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire; and (so does) the praying of a man in the depths of the night.
</p>
<p>Then he pbuh recited:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse=32:16></p>
<p class="quote">
    (Those) who forsake their beds to cry to their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of what We have bestowed upon them. No soul knows what is kept hidden for them of joy, as a reward for what they used to do.
</p>
<p>Then he pbuh said:</p>
<p class="quote">Shall I not tell you of the peak of the matter, its pillar and its uppermost part?</p>
<p>I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allaah!' He said:</p>
<p class="quote">
    The peak of the matter is Islaam. The pillar is prayer and its uppermost part is Jihaad. Shall I not tell you what controls all that?
</p>
<p>
    I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allaah.' So he took hold of his tongue, and said: 'Restrain this!'' I said: 'O Prophet of Allaah, will we be held accountable for what we say?'' He pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="quote">
    May your mother be bereaved of you, O Mu’aadh! Is there anything that causes people to be dragged on their faces – or he said – on their noses into Hellfire other than the harvests of their tongues?<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">إِنَّ مِنْ حُسْنِ إِسْلاَمِ الْمَرْءِ تَرْكَهُ مَا لاَ يَعْنِيهِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    From the goodness of an individual's Islaam is that he abandons (talking about) those things which do not concern him.
</p>

<p>
    Imaam Ash-Shaafi'ee (rahimahullaah) said to his student Rabee': "O Rabee'! Do not speak about things that do not concern you, for indeed every time that you speak a word, it takes control of you and you do not have control of it!"
</p>
<p>Abdullaah bin Masood said: "There is nothing that deserves to be imprisoned more than the tongue."</p>
