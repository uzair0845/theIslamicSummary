<h3>concerning gossiping</h3>
<p>Imaam Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee said:</p>
<p class="quote">
    For the most part, gossip is attributed to the one who takes the statement of a person (concerning another individual), and relates it back to that individual that is being spoken about. An example of this is when someone says: 'That person said such and such about you.' However, gossiping is not limited to just this example, but rather its extent is: Exposing that which one hates to have exposed, whether the one he is relating from or the one he is relating the story to or the third party hates it. And it is the same if this exposing is done by speech or by writing or by gesturing, etc, and regardless whether what is being narrated relates to someone’s sayings or actions or a defect he has or other than that. So the reality of Gossiping is: Spreading what is supposed to be private, and destroying the concealment of what he hates to have exposed.

    A person must keep quiet with regard to anything he sees (or hears) from the conditions of people except for that which, if he relates it, will have a benefit for a Muslim or will prevent a sin from occurring.

    He also said: Anyone that has gossip (nameemah) conveyed to him, and it is said to him: 'Such and such person said this about you', then there are six things required from him:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        He must not believe him because the one conveying the news is a gossiper (Namaam), and the gossiper is a wicked person (faasiq), so his reports are rejected.<sup></sup>
    </li>
    <li>He must forbid him from doing that, advise him and declare the detestability of his action.</li>
    <li>
        He must hate him for the sake of Allaah, for indeed, he is hated in the sight of Allaah and hating for the sake of Allaah is an obligation.
    </li>
    <li>
        He must not think evil thoughts about the person he is relating from, based on Allaah's saying: 'Avoid much (types of) suspicion.'<sup></sup>
    </li>
    <li>
        What has been related to you (about someone) should not cause you to spy or investigate further into the matter, because Allaah says: 'And do not spy on one another.'<sup></sup>
    </li>
    <li>
        He should not be pleased for himself with what he has forbidden for the gossiper. Thus he should not report the gossip that was conveyed to him by saying: 'Such and such person told me this', for then he would become a gossiper himself and he would be committing that which he forbade.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    It has been reported that a man went to 'Umar bin 'Abd-il-'Azeez (rahimahullaah) and said something to him about another person. So 'Umar (rahimahullaah) said to him:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="49:6">إِن جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا</p>
<p class="quote">
    'If a wicked person comes to you with news, then verify it.' If you wish, we shall investigate your case. If you are lying, then you are from those who fall under the ayah:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="68:11"></p>
<p class="quote">'Backbiter, going about spreading gossip.' And if you wish, we can overlook the matter.</p>
<p>So the man said: "Please overlook it, O Commander of the Believers! I will never mention it again."</p>

<ol id="reference">
    <li>
        Translator's Note: This is based on Allaah's saying: "If a wicked person (i.e. faasiq) comes to you with news, then verify it, lest you harm people without realizing it (i.e. out of ignorance) and afterwards you become regretful for what you’ve done." [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 6]
    </li>
    <li>Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12</li>
    <li>Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12</li>
