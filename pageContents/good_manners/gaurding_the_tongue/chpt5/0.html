<h3>What should one do when he hears his shaikh, friend or someone else being backbitten</h3>
<p>
    Know that it is upon the one who hears a Muslim being backbitten to oppose it and prevent the one doing the backbiting. If he is not able to prevent him with his speech, then he should stop him with his hand. If he is neither able to do so with his hand or with his tongue, then he should get up and leave that gathering.

<p>Mu'aadh bin Anas reported The Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    مَنْ حَمَى مُؤْمِنًا مِنْ مُنَافِقٍ بَعَثَ اللَّهُ مَلَكًا يَحْمِي لَحْمَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ وَمَنْ رَمَى مُسْلِمًا بِشَىْءٍ يُرِيدُ شَيْنَهُ بِهِ حَبَسَهُ اللَّهُ عَلَى جِسْرِ جَهَنَّمَ حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ مِمَّا قَالَ
</p>
<p class="quote">
    Whoever protects a believer from a hypocrite, Allaah will send forth an angel that will protect his flesh on the Day of Judgement from (being burned by) the fire of Hell. And whoever accuses a Muslim of anything, desiring to disgrace him, Allaah will withhold him over the bridge of the Hellfire until he takes back what he said.
