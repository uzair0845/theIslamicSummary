<p class="arabic">قال رحمه الله: بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p><p class="quote">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p><hr><p>He began, may Allaah have mercy upon him, this treatise with the Basmalah, following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the first thing which you see in the mus-haf (the printed copy of the Qur'aan), and before every soorah of it is, "In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy".</p><p>So therefore it is used to begin treatises, or letters and books and works following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And likewise the Prophet (PBUH) used to write it at the start of his letters when he wrote to the governors and the chiefs and to those who were in the different regions of the earth.</p><p>And he (PBUH) used to begin his talks and his speech with, "In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy", which shows that beginning with, "In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy", is the sunnah of the Messenger (PBUH), just as Sulaymaan 'alaihissalaam when he wrote to Bilqees the Queen of Saba' he began his letter with, "In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy".</p><p>So therefore those people who do not begin their works and their letters with, “In the
    Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy”, those people have left
    the Prophetic sunnah and left following the example of the Book of Allaah the Mighty
    and Majestic and perhaps because of that these books of theirs and these letters of theirs
    do not contain blessing and do not contain benefit.</p>
