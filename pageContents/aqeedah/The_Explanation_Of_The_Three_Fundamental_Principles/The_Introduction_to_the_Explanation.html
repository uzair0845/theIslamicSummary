<p>The treatise "The Three Fundamental Principles" is a tremendous treatise which is brief, supported by evidences from the Book of Allaah and the sunnah of his Messeneger (PBUH), and this small treatise is about a tremendous fundamental matter from the fundamentals of Islaam and it is <b>al-'aqeedah</b>. The scholars give importance to
these brief works, authoring them and exerting themselves to shorten them and refine
them, then they would encourage their students to memorise them so that they should
remain fundamental assets for them and a store of provision for them which they can
derive benefit from, and bring benefit to others by means of them.</p>
<p>Beginning with these shorter works is the foundation for the students of knowledge,
so the student of knowledge should begin by learning little by little, taking from the initial
points of knowledge and its fundamentals and then proceed in stages through it.</p>

<p class="quote">But rather be rabbaaniyyoon (wise scholars who cultivate the people) by your teaching them the Book and your studying it.</p>
<p><u><b>Rabbaaniyoon</b>:</u> They are those who begin with the small matters of knowledge
before the greater ones.</p>
