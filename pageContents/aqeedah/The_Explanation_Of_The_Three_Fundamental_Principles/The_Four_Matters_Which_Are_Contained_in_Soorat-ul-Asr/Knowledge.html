    something in accordance with how it actually is. To comprehend something in a manner which is contrary to how it actually is in reality,
    or to perceive something contrary to the reality of it, this is <b>ignorance</b>, and it is the
    opposite of knowledge.</p><p>His saying, "May Allaah have Mercy upon you", this is a supplication for the seeker of
    knowledge, so the shaikh makes supplication for the student of knowledge, that Allaah
    has Mercy upon him, and that He the Perfect and Most High should place Mercy upon
    them.</p><p>What is obligatory upon the
    teacher and upon whoever calls to Allaah and whoever commands the good and forbids
    the evil is to be kind and gentle with those he addresses with making supplication for him
    and complimenting him and speaking with mild speech, because this is more likely to
    bring about acceptance.</p><p>As for the obstinate opponent and the person who proudly refuses to accept, then there
    is a different way of addressing this person. Allaah the Perfect said:</p><p class="arabic" verse="29:46"></p><p class="quote">And do not debate with the People of the Book except in a manner which is best,
    except those of them who transgress. And say we truly believe in what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to you, and our Lord whom we worship and
    your Lord is One, and we are Muslims in submission to Him.</p><p>So those who transgressed from the People of the Book and knowingly and obstinately refused the truth, and rejected the truth with pride, those people are not addressed in the manner which is finest, rather they are addressed with that which will deter them. He the Most High said:</p><p class="arabic" verse="9:73"></p><p class="quote">O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern
    with them. And their final abode is the Hell-fire, and what an evil destination.</p><p>The hypocrites, they are not fought against with weapons, rather jihaad is waged against
    them with proof and speech and by refuting them with sternness as a deterrent for them,
    and in order to deter the rest of the people away from them. And He the Most High said
    with regard to them:</p><p class="arabic" verse="4:63">وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًۢا بَلِيغًۭا</p><p class="quote">And admonish them with a saying which will have an effect upon them.</p>
