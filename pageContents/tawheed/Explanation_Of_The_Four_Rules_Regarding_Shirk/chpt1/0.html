    أسأل الله الكريم، رب العرش العظيم، أن يتولاك في الدنيا والآخرة، وأن يجعلك ممن إذا أعطي شكر، وإذا ابتلي صبر، وإذا أذنب استغفر، فإن هذه الثلاث: عنوان السعادة.

    I ask Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne to befriend you in this world and the Hereafter, and to make you blessed wherever you may be. And (I ask) that He make you from those who when they are given, are thankful; when they are tested, are patient; and when they sin, seek forgiveness (from Allaah). For indeed these three characteristics are the true signs of happiness.

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
    The author has begun by supplicating and asking Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, to befriend the one who reads this book in this world and the Hereafter.  As for befriending him in this worldly life, then it is by loving him, guiding him, directing him and assisting him. And as for befriending him in the Hereafter, then it is by showing him mercy and forgiveness, protecting him from the Hellfire and admitting him into Paradise.  Then he also supplicates that he be blessed wherever he may be, and that Allaah make him fulfill the meaning of servitude, as well as its stations, which are three:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First:</span> Being thankful for His Blessing. This is at the time when He gives it, as Allaah says:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="39:7">وَإِن تَشْكُرُوا۟ يَرْضَهُ لَكُمْ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">And if you are grateful, He will be pleased therewith for you.</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="2:152">وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">And give thanks to Me and do not disbelieve.</div>
        <div>
            Being thankful for Allaah's Blessing is shown through the heart by way of affirming, acknowledging and showing gratitude. And it is shown through the tongue by way of speaking about the blessing and praising it. And it is shown through the limbs by way of acting in accordance with what pleases Allaah.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second:</span> Being patient during tribulations, hard times and with the things that one hates, which befall the people as a test and examination from Allaah. What is obligatory in these situations is that one have patience. Patience means suppressing the heart from being displeased and from despairing; suppressing the tongue from complaining; and suppressing the limbs from those acts that negate and contradict patience.  Allaah says:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="2:155">وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">And give glad tidings to those who are patient.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third:</span> Seeking forgiveness after committing a sin. This is since all of the Son of Aadam are sinners. But what is obligatory upon mankind when they should fall into sin is to rush to ask for forgiveness and repentance, as Allaah says:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="3:135"></div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            And those who when they commit some immoral act (i.e. fornication) or wrong themselves with evil, remember Allaah and so seek (His) forgiveness for their sins. And who is it that forgives sins except Allaah?  And they do not persist knowingly in what sins they committed (after that). 
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    So these are the three characteristics: Being thankful for (Allaah's) Blessing, being patient during times of tribulation, and seeking forgiveness after committing a sin.
</p>
<p>
    Whoever fulfills all of these will no doubt be from those who will experience happiness. In fact, happiness is linked to these three characteristics more than any others. All of them contain the meanings of Tawheed, submission, compliance and acceptance from Allaah.
