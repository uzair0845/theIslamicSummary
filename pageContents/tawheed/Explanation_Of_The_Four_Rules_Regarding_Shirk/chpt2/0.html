    اعلم أرشدك الله لطاعته: أن الحنيفية ملة إبراهيم، أن تعبد الله مخلصاً له الدين، وبذلك أمر الله جميع الناس، وخلقهم لها، كما قال تعالى:

<p class="arabic" verse="51:56"></p>
<p class="quote">
    Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the Haneefiyyah, the religion of Ibraaheem is that you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him, as Allaah says: "And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me."
</p>

<p class="arabic">
    فإذا عرفت: أن الله خلقك لعبادته، فاعلم: أن العبادة لا تسمى عبادة، إلا مع التوحيد، كما أن الصلاة لا تسمى صلاة، إلا مع الطهارة؛ فإذا دخل الشرك في العبادة، فسدت، كالحدث إذا دخل في الطهارة.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one's worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.
</p>

<p class="arabic">
    فإذا عرفت: أن الشرك إذا خالط العبادة أفسدها، وأحبط العمل، وصار صاحبه من الخالدين في النار؛ عرفت: أن أهم ما عليك معرفة ذلك، لعل الله أن يخلصك من هذه الشبكة، وهي الشرك بالله الذي قال الله تعالى فيه:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="4:116">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</p>
<p class="arabic">ذلك بمعرفة أربع قواعد، ذكرها الله في كتابه.</p>
<p class="quote">
    So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one's worship – spoils it, invalidates one's actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said: "Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills." This can be achieved by knowing Four Rules that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.
</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
    Al-Haneefiyyah comes from Haneef, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed.
</p>

<p>
    The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of Al-Haneefiyyah, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="4:125"></p>
<p class="quote">
    And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (i.e. himself) to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef (i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)?
</p>
<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:161"></p>
<p class="quote">
    Say (O Muhammad): 'Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he (i.e. Ibraaheem) was not from the polytheists.'
</p>

<p>So its foundation is Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:56"></p>
<p class="quote">And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.</p>
<p>
    So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. If a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and
    nullifies it.
</p>
<p>
    So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and causing it to return rejected to the one that performed it and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, then at this point it will become clear that the
    most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.
