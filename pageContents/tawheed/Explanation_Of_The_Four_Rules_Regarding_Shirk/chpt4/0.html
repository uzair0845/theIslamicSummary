    ما دعوناهم وتوجهنا إليهم، إلا لطلب القربة، والشفاعة، ونريد من الله لا منهم، لكن بشفاعتهم، والتقرب إلى الله بهم، فدليل القربة، قوله تعالى:

    They (i.e. the disbelievers) said: "We did not invoke them nor turn towards them except to seek nearness (to Allah) and (their) intercession." The proof for their seeking nearness (to Allaah) is His saying: "And those who take protectors besides Him (say): 'We don't worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.' Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differ in. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever."

    The proof for their seeking intercession is Allaah's saying: "And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: 'These are our intercessors besides Allaah.'"

<p class="arabic">الشفاعة شفاعتان: شفاعة منفية وشفاعة مثبتة</p>
<p class="quote">Intercession is of two types: Intercession that is negated and Intercession that is affirmed.</p>

<p class="arabic">فالشفاعة المنفية، هي التي تطلب من غير الله، فيما لا يقدر عليه إلا الله؛ والدليل قوله تعالى:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:254"></p>
<p class="quote">
    The Negated Intercession is that which is sought from someone other than Allaah in matters that no one has the ability to carry out except Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah's saying: "O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrong-doers."
</p>

<p class="arabic">والمثبتة، هي التي تطلب من الله؛ والشافع مكرم بالشفاعة؛ والمشفوع له: من رضي الله قوله وعمله، بعد الإذن؛ والدليل قوله تعالى:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:255">مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦ</p>
<p class="quote">
    The Affirmed Intercession is that which is sought from Allaah. The intercessor is one who is granted the honor of being able to intercede (by Allaah), while the one who is interceded for is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions. (All of these occur) after Allaah’s permission is granted, as Allaah says: "Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission."
</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>
    Shufa'aaunaa (our intercessors) is the plural of shaafi' and shafee', and he is the one that gets in between (two parties) in order to bring some benefit or to repel some harm; Khillah (friendship) mutual love.
</p>
<p>
    These disbelievers used as an argument for their supplicating and worshipping of other gods besides Allaah, the claim that they did not call unto them nor turn to them except for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            So that these things (i.e. false gods) that they were worshipping could bring them nearer to Allaah. The proof for the first reason is Allaah's saying: 
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="39:3">وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            And those who take protectors besides Him (say): 'We don't worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.'
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        
        <div>So that they may intercede for them before Allaah.</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="10:18">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ شُفَعَٰٓؤُنَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: These are our intercessors besides Allaah.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Shaikh explains that Intercession is of two types in the Book of Allaah. The first is an intercession that the Qur’aan has negated, rejected and restricted that it be achieved, and the second type is the Affirmed Intercession, which the Qur'aan has affirmed will occur on the Day of Judgement, based on the clear evidences.
</p>

<p>As for the Intercession that Allaah has negated in His Book:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:254">يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَنفِقُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌۭ لَّا بَيْعٌۭ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌۭ وَلَا شَفَٰعَةٌۭ</p>
<p>
    It is the Intercession that is sought from other than Allaah in matters that no one has control over except Allaah, such as a person who seeks entrance into Paradise from other than Allaah, for example, or to be saved from the Hellfire.
</p>
<p>
    As for the Affirmed Intercession, then it is that which is sought from Allaah and which occurs with His permission. So the one who intercedes, Allaah has granted him the honor of interceding. As for the one who is interceded for, he is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions, after He has given His permission for him to be interceded for. This is as Allaah says: 
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:255">مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦ</p>
<p class="quote">Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission</p>
<p>The true intercession, which is the affirmed one cannot occur unless two conditions are first met:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Permission for the intercessor to intercede, as is stated in the previous ayah.</li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for. This is as is stated in Allaah's statement:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic" verse="21:28">وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِۦ مُشْفِقُونَ</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            And they cannot intercede except for he whom Allaah is pleased with. And they stand in awe from fear of Allaah.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
