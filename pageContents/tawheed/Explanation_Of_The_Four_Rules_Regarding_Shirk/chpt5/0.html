    The Prophet pbuh was sent to people that differed from one another in their worship. Among them were those who worshipped the angels. And among them were those who worshipped the prophets and righteous people. And among them were those who worshipped trees and stones. And among them were those who worshipped the sun and the moon. However, the Messenger of Allaah pbuh fought against (all of) them and did not differentiate between any of them. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: "And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (trial, i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah alone."

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>
    The Prophet (pbuh) was indeed sent to a people who varied in their worship and differed in their religions. Among them were those that worshipped angels and (those that worshipped) prophets and righteous people, and those that worshipped trees and stones or the sun and the moon. So Allaah legislated for His Prophet to fight against them. Rather, He commanded him to do that without differentiating between any of them. He commanded him to fight against every one of them until all of the Religion (i.e. worship) became solely for Allaah and until islaam gained supremacy over all other religions. Allaah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="8:39"></p>
<p class="quote">
    And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah.
</p>
<p>
    So the Prophet pbuh fought against all of them until he brought them under the rule and laws of Islaam. From the texts that provide evidence that there existed those who worshipped the sun and the moon and that Allaah forbade them from doing that is His saying:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="41:37"></p>
<p class="quote">
    And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.
</p>
<p>
    And from the evidences that indicate that there existed those who used to worship the angels, and that Allaah forbade them from doing that, is Allaah's saying:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="3:80">وَلَا يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُوا۟ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّۦنَ أَرْبَابًا</p>
<p class="quote">And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).</p>
<p>
    And from what makes it clear that there existed those who would worship the prophets and that this worship of theirs was false is Allaah’s saying:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="5:116">وَإِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ءَأَنتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ ٱتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَٰهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ ۖ قَالَ سُبْحَٰنَكَ</p>
<p class="quote">
    And when Allaah will say: 'O Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?' He will say: 'Glory be to You.'
</p>
<p>
    So Eesaa, peace be on him, will free himself from their worshipping of him and rule upon its falsehood. And from the proofs that show that there existed those who would worship the righteous people and the ruling that this is futile, is Allaah's saying:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="17:57">أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُۥ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ</p>
<p class="quote">
    Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the scholars of Tafseer said: There was a group amongst the Arabs that used to worship some individuals amongst the Jinn. Afterward, these Jinn accepted Islaam, but those people who worshipped them did not know this. So Allaah explains to them that those people whom you worship, they themselves seek nearness to Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.
</p>
<p>
    From that which indicates that there existed those who would worship trees is the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaah 'anhu) when some of the Companions went out with the Prophet during the battle of Hunayn. And among them were those who had just recently come out of disbelief, i.e. they had only become Muslims a little while before. So they saw a lote-tree that belonged to the polytheists, known as Dhaat Anwaat, which the polytheists would seek blessings from and hang their swords on. So they asked the Prophet pbuh to make for them a Dhaat Anwaat tree just like theirs.
</p>
<p>
    At this the Prophet said Allaahu Akbar, became very angry and was stern in his speech, forbidding them from this. He said to them:
</p>
<p class="quote">
    You have just said, by the One in whose hand my soul is, similar to what the companions of Moosaa said to him: 'Make for us a god just as they have gods.' He replied: 'Verily you are a people given into ignorance'
</p>
<p>
    So this hadeeth proves that there existed those polytheists who would worship trees. It also proves that believing in trees (i.e. that they have the ability to bring good or repel harm) amounts to disbelief. It also proves that even the noble and scholarly amongst people may fall into Shirk, while not being aware of it. It also proves that if a person utters a statement of disbelief while not knowing that it amounts to disbelief or intentionally doing it, he does not commit disbelief until he is fully aware (of what he is saying).
</p>
<p>
    Allaah has declared all of these different types of worship false and futile. And He commanded His Messenger to fight against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.
