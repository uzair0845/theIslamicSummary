<p class="arabic" verse="10:31"></p>
<p class="quote">
    You must know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah pbuh fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator. But this (belief) did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. The proof for this is Allaah's saying: "Say: 'Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?' They will surely say: 'Allaah.' Say: 'Will you then not be dutiful to Him?'"
</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
    Muqirroon (agreed) means they acknowledged; Al-Mudabbir (Administrator) The One who disposes of all affairs; tattaqoon (dutiful) means putting a shield and a barrier between yourselves and what you fear. 
</p>

<p>
    The first of these rules is: Knowing that the polytheists during the time of Allaah's Messenger, from the disbelievers of Makkah and others, affirmed and acknowledged Allaah's Lordship (Ruboobiyyah), which is to single Allaah out and make Him one with regard to His creating, administering and controlling of the universe. They did not ascribe partners to Him in these aspects. The proof for this is Allaah's saying:

<p>
    The ayaat that provide evidence for this are many. All of them make it clear that the polytheists acknowledged that Allaah alone was the only Creator, Provider and Administrator of all affairs. However, they ascribed and mixed partners with Him in worship, so this acknowledgement was of no benefit to them. And this did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam nor did it make their lives and wealth sacred (i.e. unlawful to be violated). Rather, the Prophet (pbuh) fought against them and made lawful (the taking of) their lives and their wealth because of that.

<p>
    They were not judged as being Muslims simply because they acknowledged and agreed to Allaah's Lordship. Rather he (pbuh) made their abiding by Tawheed Al-Uloohiyyah (i.e. that worship is only for Allaah), acknowledging it and acting upon it as a condition for judging them as Muslims, withholding from causing harm to them, and sparing their lives.
