<div id="QABlock">
	<p class="question">What three characteristics are the true signs of happiness?</p>
	<p class="answer">Being thankful after Allah gives you something; being patient when tested; seeking forgiveness after sinning.</p>
	<p class="question">What is Al-haneefiyah?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		It is the religion of Ibraaheem, which is that you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him and not mix partners into His worship.
	</p>
	<p class="question">For what purpose did Allah create you?</p>
	<p class="answer">He created us to worship Him, as He stated in Surah Adh-Dhariyaat:</p>
	<p class="arabic">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p>
	<p class="question">What are the consequences of Shirk?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		Shirk spoils one's worship and causes a person's good deeds to be invalidated, and the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.
	</p>
	<p class="question">What is the most important thing a person is obligated to learn?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.
	</p>
	<p class="question">What is the fist rule regarding shirk?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		That the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator, but this belief did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. 
	</p>
	<p class="question">What is the second rule regarding shirk?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		That The disbelievers said: "We did not invoke them nor turn towards them except to seek nearness (to Allah) and (their) intercession."
	</p>
	<p class="question">What are the two types of intercession?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		Intercession is of two types: Intercession that is negated and Intercession that is affirmed.
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The Negated Intercession is that which is sought from someone other than Allaah in matters that no one has the ability to carry out except Allaah.
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The Affirmed Intercession is that which is sought from Allaah. The intercessor is one who is granted the honor of being able to intercede (by Allaah), while the one who is interceded for is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions.
	</p>
	<p class="question">What is the third rule regarding shirk?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The Prophet pbuh was sent to people that differed from one another in their worship. Among them were those who worshipped the angels; among them were those who worshipped the prophets and righteous people; among them were those who worshipped trees and stones; among them were those who worshipped the sun and the moon. However, the Messenger of Allaah pbuh fought against (all of) them and did not differentiate between any of them.
	</p>
	<p class="question">What is the fourth rule regarding shirk?</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The polytheists in our era are more severe in their (committing of) Shirk than the first polytheists (during the Prophet's time). This was since the first polytheists used to ascribe partners to Allaah at times of ease and worship Him sincerely during times of hardship. However, the polytheists in our era constantly commit Shirk in times of ease as well as in times of hardship.
