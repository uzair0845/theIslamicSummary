    أن مشركي زماننا، أغلظ شركاً من الأولين، لأن الأولين يخلصون لله في الشدة، ويشركون في الرخاء؛ ومشركي زماننا: شركهم دائم، في الرخاء والشدة

    The polytheists in our era are more severe in their (committing of) Shirk than the first polytheists (during the Prophet’s time). This was since the first polytheists used to ascribe partners to Allaah at times of ease and worship Him sincerely during times of hardship. However, the polytheists in our era constantly commit Shirk in times of ease as well as in times of hardship.
</p>

<p class="arabic">والدليل قوله تعالى:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="29:65"></p>
<p class="quote">
    The proof for this is Allaah's statement: "And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others."
</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
    This is the fourth and last rule, which is that the polytheists in our time, those who devote a share of their worship to other than Allaah, such as the righteous people that are buried in graves and so on, are greater in Shirk and stronger in disbelief than the first polytheists.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for this is because the first polytheists would ascribe partners to Allaah during times of ease only, and as for times of hardness and difficulty, they would call sincerely out to Allaah (for help) and they knew that no one else could save them and that their (false) gods would not benefit them. What indicates this is Allaah's saying:
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="29:65"></p>
<p class="quote">
    And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.
</p>

<p>And also Allaah's saying:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:63-64"></p>
<p class="quote">
    Say: Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): 'If He only saves us from this (danger), we will truly be grateful.' Say: Allaah rescues you from this and from all other distresses, but yet you worship others besides Allaah.
</p>

<p>
    So these ayaat (verses) indicate that they would mix partners in their worship with Allaah during times of ease only, but as for times of hardship then they wouldn't. As for those who commit Shirk in our time, then they indeed mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both these conditions. If some blessing and comfort befalls them, they rush to the graves, presenting them with sacrificial offerings and slaughtering animals at their sites. And they put forth thanks to the deceased buried within them and glorify them with praises. If some calamity befalls them, they rush to these graves and seek help from them, supplicating to them and making oaths to them for such and such if this calamity is removed from them.
