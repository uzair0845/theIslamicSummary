<h4>From The Tafsir Of Al-Fatihah</h4>
<p>
	Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim are two names derived from Ar-Rahmah (the mercy), but Rahman has more meanings that pertain to mercy than Ar-Rahim. There is a statement by Ibn Jarir that indicates that there is a consensus on this meaning. Further, Al-Qurtubi said, "The proof that these names are derived (from Ar-Rahmah), is what At-Tirmidhi recorded - and graded Sahih - from Abdur-Rahman bin Awf that he heard the Messenger of Allah pbuh say,
</p>
<p class="arabic">
	قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى: أَنَا الرَّحْمنُ خَلَقْتُ الرَّحِمَ وَشَقَقْتُ لَهَا اسْمًا مِنِ اسْمِي، فَمَنْ وَصَلَهَا وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَها قَطَعْتُهُ

	Allah the Exalted said, 'I Am Ar-Rahman. I created the Raham (womb, i.e. family relations) and derived a name for it from My Name. Hence, whoever keeps it, I will keep ties to him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties with him.'
</p>

<p>
	Al-Qurtubi said,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	It was said that both Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim have the same meaning, such as the words Nadman and Nadim, as Abu Ubayd has stated. Abu Ali Al-Farisi said that Ar-Rahman, which is exclusively for Allah, is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah has. Ar-Rahim is what effects the believers, for Allah said,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="33:43">وَكَانَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً</p>
<p class="quote">
	Also, Ibn Abbas said - about Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, 'They are two soft names, one of them is softer than the other (meaning it carries more implications of mercy).'
</p>
<p>
	Ibn Jarir said; As-Surri bin Yahya At-Tamimi narrated to me that Uthman bin Zufar related that Al-Azrami said about Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, "He is Ar-Rahman with all creation and Ar-Rahim with the believers." Hence. Allah's statements,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="20:5">الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى</p>
<p>
	Allah thus mentioned the Istawa - rising over the Throne - along with His Name Ar-Rahman, to indicate that His mercy encompasses all of His creation.
</p>

<p>Allah's Name Ar-Rahman is exclusively His. For instance, Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:45"></p>
<p class="quote">And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: "Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides Ar-Rahman</p>
<p>As for Allah's Name Ar-Rahim, Allah has described others by it. For instance, Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="9:128"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad ) is anxious over you (to be rightly guided) for the believers (he is) kind (full of pity), and Rahim.
