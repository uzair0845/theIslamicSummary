    This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform wudhoo in obedience to the order of Allaah Ta'aala and His Messenger (pbuh). Ibn Taymiyyah (rahima-hullaah) said:

<p class="quote">
    The place of the niyyah is the heart and not the tongue in all forms of 'ibaadah - and that is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars - Purification, Prayer, Zakaat, Sawm, Hajj, 'Itq (freeing of slaves), Jihaad, etc. If he were to express with his tongue other than that which he intended in his heart - then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that will not count - by total agreement of all the scholars of Islaam - so the niyyah is the firm intention and resolve itself.<sup></sup>
