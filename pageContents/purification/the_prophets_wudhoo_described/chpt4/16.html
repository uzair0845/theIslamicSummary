<p>Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah reports:</p>
<p class="arabic">أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَوَضَّأَ فَمَسَحَ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ وَعَلَى الْعِمَامَةِ وَعَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ</p>
<p class="quote">The Prophet pbuh made wudhoo and wiped over his forelock and over the turban and leather socks.<sup></sup></p>
<p>
    Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee': And if part of the head is uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over that along with the turban - that is recorded from Ahmad: as the Prophet pbuh wiped over his turban and forelock - as occurs in the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah.
</p>
<p>
    As for caps/'prayer hats', it is not permissible to wipe over them as Ahmad says for various reasons, from them:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>They do not cover all of the head normally, nor are they tied around it.</li>
    <li>There is no difficulty in their removal.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    As for the woman's head cover - it is permissible to wipe over it as Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover.
