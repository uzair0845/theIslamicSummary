    Humraan narrates that 'Uthmaan called for water to make wudhoo and washed his hands three times... then said: I saw Rasoolullaah (pbuh) make wudhoo just as I have made wudhoo.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p> Abu Hurayrah said: Rasoolullaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    إِذَا اسْتَيْقَظَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ فَلاَ يَغْمِسْ يَدَهُ فِي الإِنَاءِ حَتَّى يَغْسِلَهَا ثَلاَثًا فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَدْرِي أَيْنَ بَاتَتْ يَدُهُ
</p>

    When anyone amongst you wakes up from sleep, he must not put his hand in the utensil till he has washed it three times, for he does not know where his hand was during the night.<sup></sup>

    In the hadeeth of 'Abdullaah ibn Zayd he was asked about the wudhoo of the Prophet pbuh, so he called for a bowl of water and made wudhoo from it as the Prophet pbuh made wudhoo, and he poured out water from the bowl upon his hand and washed it three times.<sup></sup>
