<p>'Uthmaan (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) narrated:</p>
<p class="arabic">أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ تَوَضَّأَ فَخَلَّلَ لِحْيَتَهُ</p>
<p class="quote">
    that the Prophet (pbuh) used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it - then he must repeat the ( wudhoo and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imaam Ishaaq and Abu Thaur.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an order of desirability (istihbaab) and it is not obligatory - and that it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through that part of the beard..so that it reaches the skin underneath.
</p>

<p>
    Imam Ahmad and Layth and most of the scholars hold that moving water through the beard is obligatory when taking ghusl from Janaabah - and not obligatory in wudhoo.
