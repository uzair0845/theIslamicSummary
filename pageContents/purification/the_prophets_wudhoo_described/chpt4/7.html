<p>Abu Hurayrah narrates that the Prophet pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">إِذَا تَوَضَّأَ أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَجْعَلْ فِي أَنْفِهِ مَاءً ثُمَّ لْيَنْثُرْ</p>
<p class="quote">When one of you makes wudhoo then let him enter water into his nose, then expel it.<sup></sup></p>

<p>
    Exerting in sniffing in the water as long as you are not fasting is reported in the hadeeth of Laqeet who said: O Rasoolullaah pbuh, inform me of the wudhoo. He said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">أَسْبِغِ الْوُضُوءَ وَخَلِّلْ بَيْنَ الأَصَابِعِ وَبَالِغْ فِي الاِسْتِنْشَاقِ إِلاَّ أَنْ تَكُونَ صَائِمًا</p>
<p class="quote">Complete the wudhoo and rub between the fingers and excert in breathing in the water into the nose unless you are fasting.<sup></sup></p>

<p>
    It is clear from these two aHaadeeth that washing the mouth and nose are both obligatory (waajib). Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee': Washing the nose and washing the mouth are both obligatory in both forms of purification - Ghusl and wudhoo - as washing the face is obligatory in both of them in the established view of the madhhab; and it is the saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn Abee Layla and Ishaaq, and it is reported from 'Ataa.
