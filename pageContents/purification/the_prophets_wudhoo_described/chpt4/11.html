    Humraan ibn Abaan reports that 'Uthmaan (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) called for water for wudhoo and mentioned the Prophet's (pbuh) way of making wudhoo - and Humraan said:
</p>

<p class="arabic">ثُمَّ غَسَلَ يَدَهُ الْيُمْنَى إِلَى الْمِرْفَقِ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ ثُمَّ غَسَلَ يَدَهُ الْيُسْرَى مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ</p>
<p class="quote">
    Then he washed his right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same way.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Nu'aym ibn Mijmar said:</p>
<p class="arabic">رَأَيْتُ أَبَا هُرَيْرَةَ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَغَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ فَأَسْبَغَ الْوُضُوءَ ثُمَّ غَسَلَ يَدَهُ الْيُمْنَى حَتَّى أَشْرَعَ فِي الْعَضُدِ ثُمَّ يَدَهُ الْيُسْرَى حَتَّى أَشْرَعَ فِي الْعَضُدِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    He washed his face and washed it well. He then washed his right hand including a portion of his arm. He then washed his left hand including a portion of his arm.
</p>
<p>In the end of the hadeeth he said:</p>
<p class="arabic">رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَتَوَضَّأُ</p>
<p class="quote">This is how I saw Allah's Messenger (pbuh) perform his ablution.<sup></sup></p>
