<p>Wiping over all of the head as Allaah Ta'ala says:</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="5:6">وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ</p>
<p class="quote">rub your heads (with water)</p>
<p>Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee':</p>
<p class="quote">
    Some of the people who claim that that which is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only - claim that the ب [in the verse] means "part of" as if He had said: "وَامْسَحُوا بَعْضَ رُءُوسِكُمْ". However, we say that in His saying "وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ" the ب is as if He said regarding Tayammum "فَامْسَحُوا بِوُجُوهِكُمْ."
</p>
<p class="quote">
    Ibn Burhaan said: "He who claims that the ب means "part of" has declared before the scholars of the language that of which they have no knowledge."<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    In the hadeeth of'Abdullaah ibn Zayd is a further proof of the incorrectness of the saying that it means "a part of": 
</p>
<p class="arabic">أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ رَأْسَهُ بِيَدَيْهِ فَأَقْبَلَ بِهِمَا وَأَدْبَرَ بَدَأَ بِمُقَدَّمِ رَأْسِهِ ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ بِهِمَا إِلَى قَفَاهُ ثُمَّ رَدَّهُمَا حَتَّى رَجَعَ إِلَى الْمَكَانِ الَّذِي بَدَأَ مِنْهُ</p>
<p>
    The Prophet pbuh wiped his head with his two hands, moving them forwards and backwards - beginning with the front of the head and (wiping) with them up to his nape then he pbuh returned them to the place from which he began.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the head. It is authentically reported that Rasoolullaah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">الأُذُنَانِ مِنَ الرَّأْسِ</p>
<p>The two ears are a part of the head.<sup></sup></p>
