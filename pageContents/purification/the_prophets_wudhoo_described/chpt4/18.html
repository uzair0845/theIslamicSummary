<p>Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not established from the Prophet pbuh.</p>
<p>
    As for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah "وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ" and saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the heads, then this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the order to wash) the hands.
</p>
<p>
    As for the reading of the word (أَرْجُلِكُمْ) with Kasra of the laam, then As-San'aanee says: That is for wiping over the leather socks - as is shown by the Sunnah - and this is the best interpretation for this particular recital.
</p>

<p>
    The Quraan is not to be explained according to the human intellect - especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and wudhoo, etc. - but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And there are many such examples in the Qur'an which the Prophet pbuh explained by his sayings - and from this is the washing of the feet - and its proof from the Sunnah has preceded.
</p>
<p>
    If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet pbuh just as washing the foot is also established in the Sunnah.
</p>

<p>The great majority of scholars have agreed that it is obligatory to wash the feet.</p>
