    In the hadeeth of 'Amr ibn Yahyaa he said: And he washed his mouth and nose using three handfuls of water.<sup></sup>

    Al-Imaam an-Nawawee says: And in this hadeeth is a clear proof for the correct opinion that the sunnah in washing the mouth and nose is that it should be with three handfuls of water - washing the mouth and nose [together] with each of them.
