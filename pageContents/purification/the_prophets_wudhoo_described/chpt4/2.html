<p>Abu Hurayrah said that Rasoolullaah (PBUH) said:</p>
<p class="arabic">لاَ وُضُوءَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ</p>
<p class="quote">There is no wudhoo for him who does not mention Allaah's name upon it.<sup></sup></p>

<p> 
    As for Ibn Taymiyyah he held it to be obligatory if the related hadeeth was authentic - as occurs in his Kitaab-ul-Imaan - and the hadeeth is authentic, so therefore his opinion is that it is obligatory.
</p>
<p>
    Ibn Qudaamah adds: If we take the saying that it is obligatory, then the wudhoo of one who deliberately leaves it is not correct as he has left an obligatory duty in Purification - just as if he had left the intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his purification is correct. And this is the saying that we regard as being correct.
</p>
<p>
    So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who forgets should mention Allaah's name when he remembers.
