<p>Allah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="5:6">وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ</p>
<p class="quote">...and (wash) your feet to the ankles</p>
<p>Ibn Amr said:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    تَخَلَّفَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَنَّا فِي سَفْرَةٍ، فَأَدْرَكَنَا وَقَدْ أَرْهَقْنَا الْعَصْرَ، فَجَعَلْنَا نَتَوَضَّأُ وَنَمْسَحُ عَلَى أَرْجُلِنَا، فَنَادَى بِأَعْلَى صَوْتِهِ‏ "‏وَيْلٌ لِلأَعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّارِ"‏‏.‏ مَرَّتَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلاَثًا‏
</p>
<p class="quote">
    Rasoolullaah pbuh fell behind us and then came upon us during a journey, then we found him and it was time for 'Asr - so we began to make wudhoo and wipe over our feet, so he pbuh called out at the top of his voice "Woe to the ankles from the Fire" two or three times.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    An-Nawawee says in his explanation of Saheeh Muslim after mentioning the hadeeth: Muslim's intention in quoting these hadeeth was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet - and that wiping them is not sufficient.
</p>

<p>
    In the hadeeth of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from Humraan ibn Abaan that 'Uthmaan (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) called for water for wudhoo and then mentioned the wudhoo of the Prophet pbuh - then Humraan said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">ثُمَّ غَسَلَ رِجْلَهُ الْيُمْنَى إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ ثُمَّ الْيُسْرَى مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ</p>
<p class="quote">Then he washed his right foot to the ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.<sup></sup></p>

<p>From what is mentioned in Sahih Muslim of what Abu Hurairah did:</p>
<p class="arabic">غَسَلَ رِجْلَهُ الْيُمْنَى حَتَّى أَشْرَعَ فِي السَّاقِ ثُمَّ غَسَلَ رِجْلَهُ الْيُسْرَى حَتَّى أَشْرَعَ فِي السَّاقِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    He washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he washed the left foot till he reached the shin<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>In the end of the hadeeth he said: "This is what I saw Rasoolullaah pbuh do."</p>
<p>From this hadeeth - O Brother Muslim - it becomes clear that the ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying 'حَتَّى أَشْرَعَ فِي السَّاقِ'.</p>

<p>Al-Mustaurad (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) said:</p>
<p class="arabic">كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم إِذَا تَوَضَّأَ دَلَكَ أَصَابِعَ رِجْلَيْهِ بِخِنْصَرِهِ</p>
<p class="quote">
    When the Prophet pbuh made wudhoo he would enter the water between his toes with his little finger.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    As-San'aanee says in 'Subul-us-Salaam' after quoting this hadeeth: It is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes - and this also occurs in the hadeeth of Ibn 'Abbaas which we have indicated - which is reported by at-Tirmidhee, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim - and authenticated by al-Bukhaaree. And it is done by using the little finger.
</p>

<p>Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: Rasoolullaah pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">أَسْبِغِ الْوُضُوءَ وَخَلِّلْ بَيْنَ الأَصَابِعِ</p>
<p class="quote">Complete the wudhoo and wipe between the Asaabi' (fingers and/or toes).<sup></sup></p>
