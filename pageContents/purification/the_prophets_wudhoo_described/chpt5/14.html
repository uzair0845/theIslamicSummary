    'Uthman ibn 'Affaan, al-Hasan ibn 'Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, 'Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak, 'Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya'laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha'bee, Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn 'Umar in a narration, and Abu Haneefah, Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi'ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it is permissible after both wudhoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts.
</p>
<p>Their evidence is what 'Aaishah (radhiAllaahu 'anhaa) reports:</p>
<p class='arabic'>كَانَ لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم خِرْقَةٌ يُنَشِّفُ بِهَا بَعْدَ الْوُضُوءِ</p>
<p class='quote'>Rasoolullaah (pbuh) had a cloth which he used to dry himself with after making wudhoo.<sup></sup></p>
<p>
    Its reported by at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da'eef, then Al-Ainee states that an-Nasaa.ee records it in 'al-Kunaa' with saheeh isnaad.
</p>

<p>Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates</p>
<p class='arabic'>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ تَوَضَّأَ فَقَلَبَ جُبَّةَ صُوفٍ كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِ فَمَسَحَ بِهَا وَجْهَهُ</p>
<p class='quote'>The Prophet (pbuh) made wudhoo, then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped his face with it.<sup></sup></p>
<p>In az-Zawaaid, it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p>
    I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn 'Ataa who is sadooq but has a bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in 'Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb', so its isnaad is da'eef!! - but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of 'Aa.ishah to the level of hasan - and Allaah Knows best.
</p>

<p>
    Others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after Purification and their proof is what is established from Maymoonah (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhaa) who described the Prophet's (pbuh) ghusl from Janaabah and said:
</p>
<p class='arabic'>فَنَاوَلْتُهُ ثَوْبًا فَلَمْ يَأْخُذْهُ</p>
<p class='quote'>Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.<sup></sup></p>

<p>
    The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aaishah (radhiAllaahu 'anhaa) - as for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the saying of Maymoonah (radhiAllaahu 'anhaa) "but he refused it" does not amount to the fact that it is makrooh - and Allaah Knows best.
