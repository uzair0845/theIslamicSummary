    Ibn 'Abbaas (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) took a ghusl from Janaabah then saw Rasoolullaah (pbuh) about to take a ghusl from the water remaining - so she informed him that she had made ghusl therefrom - so Rasoolulah said:
</p>
<p class='arabic'>إِنَّ الْمَاءَ لاَ يَجْنُبُ</p>
<p class='quote'>Nothing makes the water impure.</p>
 
<p>Ibn 'Abd ul-Barr says:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    There is nothing in the Sharee'ah to prevent each of them washing with the water remaining from the other - either together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars - and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir.
