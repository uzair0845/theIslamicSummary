<p>Al-Haafiz says in 'al-Fat.h'  in the question 'Making wudhoo without having broken it':</p>

<p class='quote'>
    Anas (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) says: The Prophet (pbuh) used to make wudhoo for every prayer. I said: What had you (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One wudhoo was sufficient for us till such time as we broke it.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>This hadeeth is an evidence that what is meant generally is the obligatory Prayer.</p>

<p>
    Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him (pbuh) particularly - then was abrogated on the Day of Fath by the hadeeth of Buraidah - meaning that which Muslim reports - that he (pbuh) prayed all the Prayers on the Day of Fath with one wudhoo and that 'Umar (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) asked him about that so he (pbuh) said:
</p>
<p class='quote'>I did it deliberately.</p>
<p>
    Or it may be that he (pbuh) used to do it out of desirability only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so left it to show the permissibility of that.
</p>
<p>
    I say: The result is that making wudhoo for every Prayer is mustahabb and praying all of the Prayers with one wudhoo is permissible - and Allaah Knows best.
