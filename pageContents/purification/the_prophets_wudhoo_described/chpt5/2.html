    As for what is related with regard to the Prophet's (pbuh) wudhoo then it has been reported sometimes out of the regular order. And the proof: Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma'd Yakrib said:

<p class='quote'>
    I came to the Prophet pbuh with water for wudhoo, so he washed his hands three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times, then wiped his head and ears - their outsides and insides - and washed each of his feet three times<sup></sup>

    So this is a proof that he pbuh did not always stick to the regular order - and this is a proof that it is not obligatory - however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is Sunnah. And Allaah Knows best.
