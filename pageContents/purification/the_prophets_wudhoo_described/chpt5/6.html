<p>Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>
    مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُبْلِغُ - أَوْ فَيُسْبِغُ - الْوُضُوءَ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلاَّ فُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةُ يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاءَ

    None of you makes wudhoo and completes the wudhoo then says: "I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger" except that all eight Gates of Paradise are opened for him - so that he enters by whichever he pleases.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>And at-Tirmidhee adds an authentic addition to it:</p>
<p class='arabic'>للَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>O Allaah, make me one of those who constantly repents to You and of those who purify themselves.<sup></sup></p>

<p>Abu Sa'eed al-Khudree (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) said Rasoolullaah (pbuh) said:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    Whoever makes wudhoo then says upon finishing the wudhoo: Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika (I declare You free from all defects my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn to You) It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened till Judgement Day.
