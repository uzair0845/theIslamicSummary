    كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَغْسِلُ ـ أَوْ كَانَ يَغْتَسِلُ ـ بِالصَّاعِ إِلَى خَمْسَةِ أَمْدَادٍ، وَيَتَوَضَّأُ بِالْمُدِّ

    The Prophet (pbuh) used to make wudhoo with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl with a saa' or up to five mudds<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    If you consider this hadeeth well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel ashamed of what some people do these days - one of them opening the water tap and making wudhoo and sometimes talking to his companion whilst the water is running out - what an excess in wastefulness! So he who does that should fear Allaah and remember this hadeeth and keep it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water sparingly and not being wasteful - and here the true following of the Prophet (pbuh) is made clear and the true Muslim's belief.
</p>
<p>
    It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to make wudhoo to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of water - in order to force himself to return to the following of the Sunnah.
