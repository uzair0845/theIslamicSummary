 <p>In the hadeeth of'Uthmaan (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) recorded by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, he (pbuh) washed each of the parts three times.</p>

    From these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is obligatory - and the second and third washings are Sunnah - and it is better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).
