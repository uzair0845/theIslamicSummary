    It is established that Ibn 'Umar (radhi-yAllaahu' anhu) urinated within the market, then made wudhoo and so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his leather socks, then prayed over it.

        Reported by Maalik (no.72) and al-Baihaqee (1/84). And 'Ataa didn't see anything wrong with leaving such gaps whilst making wudhoo and it is the saying of al-Hasan, an-Nakha'ee and the better reported of the two sayings of ash-Shaafi'ee.
