    The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree.

<p>Abu Hanifah said:</p>
<p class="arabic">هو أفضل ما استيك بفرعه من الشجر وأطيب ما رعته الماشية رائحة لبن</p>
<p class="quote">It is the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth... smelling of milk.</p>

<p>Ibn Shameel said:</p>
<p class="arabic">الأَراكُ شجرة طويلة خضراء ناعمة كثيرة الورق والأَغصان خوَّارة العود تنبت بالغَوْر تتخذ منها  المَساويك. الأَراك: شجر من الحَمْض، الواحدة أَراكة وجمعه أرائك.</p>
<p class="quote">
    The Araak is a tall fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood and growing in hollows - miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik.

<p>
    It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times as is established from the Prophet pbuh that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the Qur'an, and before sleeping and when waking, and when the breath changes - whether fasting or not - or whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form of worship which is easy therefore observe it.

<p>Aaishah (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhaa) narrates that Rasoolullaah pbuh said:</p>
<p class="arabic">السِّوَاكُ مَطْهَرَةٌ لِلْفَمِ مَرْضَاةٌ لِلرَّبِّ</p>
<p class="quote">The siwaak is a means of cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.<sup></sup></p>
