    Rasoolullaah pbuh was asked about a man's touching his penis, "should he make wudhoo?" He pbuh said: "And is it except a part of him?"<sup></sup>

    Al-Albaanee says: Its isnaad is Saheeh, and this (the view that it doesn't break the wudhoo) is established as being that of a group of the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas'ood, 'Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and because of these Imaam Ahmad gave the choice between this and the one before it.

<p>
    Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah harmonized the two carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this upon the touching without desire.
