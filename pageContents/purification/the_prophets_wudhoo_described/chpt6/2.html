 
<p>Alee ibn Abee Taalib (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullaah (sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>وِكَاءُ السَّهِ الْعَيْنَانِ فَمَنْ نَامَ فَلْيَتَوَضَّأْ</p>
<p class='quote'>The eye is the drawstring for the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make wudhoo.<sup></sup></p>

<p>
    In the hadeeth is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something that breaks wudhoo, however the Purification is broken if it is possible for something to come out from the anus - however if that is restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the case.
