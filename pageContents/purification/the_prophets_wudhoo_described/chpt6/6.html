<p>A man's touching a woman without desire does not break the wudhoo. 'Aa.ishah (radhiAllaahu 'anhaa) says:</p>

<p class='quote'>
    Rasoolullaah (pbuh) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my leg.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
    And in the same way a woman's touching a man without desire does not break wudhoo as is established from 'Aa.ishah (radhiAllaahu 'anhaa):
</p>
<p class='quote'>
    I didn't find the Prophet pbuh one night so I tried to find him with my hand - and my hand fell upon his feet which were raised up as he was making prostration.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>So we see from these two hadeeth that merely touching does not break the wudhoo - and Allaah Knows best.</p>

<p>
    The author of 'At-Ta'leeqaat us-Salafiyyah' upon Sunan of an-Nasaa.ee (1/23) says concerning "he pushed me with his foot": It is well-known that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a proof that touching without desire does not break the wudhoo. As for the touching with desire - its proof is that the wudhoo is not broken until a proof is established that it does indeed break it - and this is enough of a proof to show that it doesn't break the wudhoo for the one who holds that view - and above and beyond that is a further proof that it doesn't break the wudhoo is the hadeeth of kissing - as normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.

<p>
    The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' (1/69) says regarding her saying "he kissed me and did not make wudhoo"' - It contains a proof that touching a woman does not break the wudhoo as kissing is part of touching and the Prophet pbuh did not make wudhoo (before praying). And this (that touching a woman even with desire doesn't break the wudhoo) is the saying of 'Alee and Ibn 'Abbaas and 'Ataa ibn Taawoos, and Abu Haneefah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this hadeeth is (in itself) da'eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is mursal - however ad-Daaraqutnee joins it - and it is (therefore) an authentic (saheeh) hadeeth inshaaAllaah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).
</p>

<p>
    The author of 'al-Mughnee' (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself something which breaks wudhoo but breaks wudhoo as it leads to prostratic fluid or semen being emitted - so the condition which leads to breaking of the wudhoo is considered - and that is when there is desire.
</p>

<p>
    Summary: That when a man and woman are safe from anything being emitted which breaks wudhoo - then their wudhoo is not broken; and it is preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such emissions in the condition of desire - and Allaah Knows best.
