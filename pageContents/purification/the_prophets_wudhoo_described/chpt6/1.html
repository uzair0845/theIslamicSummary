<p>Abu Hurayrah (radhi-yAllaahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullaah (pbuh) said:</p>

<p class='arabic'>اَ يَقْبَلُ اللَّهُ صَلاَةَ أَحَدِكُمْ إِذَا أَحْدَثَ حَتَّى يَتَوَضَّأَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Allaah does not accept the prayer of any one of you having committed hadath until he makes wudhoo.<sup></sup></p>
<p>an-Nawawee says in 'al-Majmoo' (2/3) as for that which comes out of the two private parts - then it breaks wudhoo according to Allaah Ta'aalas saying:</p>
 
<p class='arabic' verse='5:7'>أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌۭ مِّنكُم مِّنَ ٱلْغَآئِطِ</p>
<p class='quote'>or one of you comes from offices of nature...</p>

<p>He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or woman breaks the wudhoo - whether excretion or urine or wind - or a worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.</p>
