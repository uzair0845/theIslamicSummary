<h4>Question</h4>
<p>In the case where a recorder is turned on and the recitation of the noble
Qur'aan is played, but some of the surrounding people do not listen to it because
they're busy talking with one another, what is the ruling concerning their not listening to
the Qur'aan? Are these people sinning or just the person who plays the Qur'aan on the
recorder?</p>
<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>The answer to this issue varies depending on the different circumstances in
which the Qur'aan is being recited from the recorder. So if the circumstance is a
gathering of knowledge, remembrance and recitation of the Qur'aan, then in this
situation, it is obligatory to pay complete attention to it. And whoever doesn't do so is
sinning because he is disobeying Allaah's statement in the Qur'aan:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='7:204'></p>
<p class='quote'>And when the Qur'aan is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, in order that you
may receive mercy</p>
<p>If it is not a gathering of knowledge, remembrance and recitation of the Qur'aan, but rather, a normal gathering, such as when a person works at home or studies or researches, then in this situation it is not permissible for this person to turn the recorder on and raise the volume of the recitation such that the sound reaches the ears of the other people inside the house or gathering. This is since, in this circumstance, these
people are not responsible for listening to the Qur'aan, since they did not gather for that occasion. The one who will be held accountable is the person who raises the volume on the recorder and causes everyone else to hear it. This is since he is
burdening the people and forcing them to listen to the Qur'aan in a situation in which they are not prepared to do this type of listening.</p>
