<h4>Question</h4>
<p>
    Noble Shaikh, I read a hadeeth in a small book, which states:
</p>
<p class="quote">Take what you wish from the Quraan for whatever you wish.</p>
<p>Is this hadeeth authentic? Please benefit us, may Allaah reward you.</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>
    This hadeeth ["Take what you wish from the Qur'aan for whatever you wish"] is a hadeeth that has become famous amongst some tongues. But unfortunately, it is one of those hadeeths that have no basis in the Sunnah. So because of this, it is not permissible to report it or ascribe it to the Prophet pbuh.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, this vast and comprehensive understanding (found in the hadeeth) is not valid and not established at all in the Legislation of Islaam:
</p>
<p class="quote">Take what you wish from the Qur'aan for whatever you wish.</p>
<p>So for example, (this hadeeth indicates that) I can just sit at home and not go out to work in my job or occupation,
instead seeking sustenance from my Lord - that He send it down to me from the sky - since I am taking what I wish from
the Qur'aan! Who says such a thing!!!</p>
<p>
    Therefore, this is a false statement. Perhaps it is a narration that was fabricated by those lazy Sufis who are accustomed to sitting and residing in those places they call ribaataat (hospices). They gather in these areas and sit there awaiting Allaah's sustenance from those people who bring it to them. This is in spite of them knowing that this is not from the nature of a Muslim since the Prophet pbuh nurtured everyone to have high aspirations and to be dignified, as he pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="quote">The upper hand is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is the one that gives and the lower hand is the one that asks (i.e. begs).<sup></sup></p>
<p>
    Concerning this topic, I was amazed by a story I once read regarding one of these ascetics and Sufis, but I will not prolong it since their tales are many and bizarre.
</p>
<p>
    They claim that one of them went out one time traveling throughout the land without any provisions. So it got to the point that he was about to die from hunger when a village appeared to him from afar, so he walked to it. This was on a Friday. According to his perception, he had gone out while putting all of his reliance upon Allaah.
</p>
<p>
    So in order not to invalidate this so called "reliance", according to his view, he didnâ€™t make himself visible to the gathering of people in the masjid. Rather, he hid himself under the mimbar (pulpit) so that no one would notice him. But he kept telling himself that perhaps someone would detect him. In the meantime, the speaker (khateeb) delivered his sermon and this man failed to pray along with the congregation! After, the Imaam finished giving his sermon and praying, the people began exiting the doors of the masjid in groups and individually. This was such that the man felt that the masjid would soon be empty, at which point the doors would be locked and he would remain alone in the masjid without any food or drink.
</p>
<p>
    So he had no choice but to make some sounds like that of one clearing his throat in order to let those present known that he was there. Some people realized someone was there so they went and found a man that looked like he had nearly transformed to just bones due to hunger and thirst. The people took hold of him and rushed to assist him.
</p>
<p>
    They asked him: "Who are you, sir?"
</p>
<p>He replied: "I am a zaahid (ascetic), one who puts his reliance in Allaah."</p>
<p>They said: "How can you say 'I am one who puts his reliance in Allaah' when you almost died. If you had truly put your reliance in Allaah, you would not have
asked (for help), nor would you have alerted the people to your presence by clearing your throat. And as a result you
would have died due to your sin!" This is an example of the extent that can be reached due to the likes of this hadeeth: "Take what you wish from the Qur'aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need)."</p>
<p>To summarize: This hadeeth has no basis to it.</p>
