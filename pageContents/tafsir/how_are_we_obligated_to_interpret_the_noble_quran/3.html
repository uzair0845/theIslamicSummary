<h4>Question</h4>
<p>There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Quran, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth:</p>
<p class='quote'>Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the
grave) due to the crying of his family for him.</p>
<p>They use the statement of Aa'ishah in
which she used Allaah's saying to refute this hadeeth:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='35:18'></p>
<p class='quote'>And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another</p>
<p>How do
we respond to those who say this?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah
by way of the Qur'aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p>As for the response to this hadeeth - and I am referring here particularly to those who
adhere to the hadeeth of Aa'ishah, then it is as follows:</p>

<p><b>From a hadeeth standpoint:</b> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn Umar ra.</li>
    <li>
        <div>Ibn Umar ra is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by Umar bin AlKhattaab ra. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu'bah ra. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</div>
        <div>If a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they "contradict" the noble Qur'aan.</div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>From a tafseer standpoint:</b> This is since the scholars have explained this
hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</div>
        <div>The usage of the word "the" when referring to the "deceased person" is not all encompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The
        hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word "the" is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</div>
        <div>As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious
        guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done, particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</div>
    </li>
    <li>A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of
this hadeeth:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>The First Fact: The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu'abah ra that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment. In the narration of Al-Mugheerah ra it states:</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>The Second Fact: When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur'aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases.</div>
    </li>
