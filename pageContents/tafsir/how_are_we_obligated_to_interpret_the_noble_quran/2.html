<h4>Question</h4>
<p>
    Noble Shaikh! The Qur'aaniyoon<sup></sup> say:
</p>
<p class="quote">Allaah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="17:12">وَكُلَّ شَىْءٍۢ فَصَّلْنَٰهُ تَفْصِيلًۭا</p>
<p class="quote">And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation.</p>
<p class="quote">And Allaah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:38">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مِن شَىْءٍۢ</p>
<p class="quote">We have not neglected anything in the Book.</p>
<p class="quote">
    And the Messenger of Allaah pbuh said: "Verily this Qur'aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it."<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>We would like your comments on this?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>As for Allaah's saying:</p>
<p class="quote">We have not neglected anything in the Book</p>
<p>What is meant by the word 'Book' here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur'aan.</p>
<p>And as for Allaah's statement:</p>
<p class="quote">And We have explained everything in detail with a full
explanation</p>
<p>If you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur'aan, then it
becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with
another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as
when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which
cannot be confined due to their large number.</p>

        This is a name given to those who claim that the Qur'aan is sufficient for deriving rules and laws in Islaam and that there is no need to turn to the Sunnah. Some even go so far as to reject the Sunnah in its entirety and rely solely on the Qur'aan.
