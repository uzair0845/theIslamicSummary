<h4>Question</h4>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:25"></p><p class="quote">And We placed veils upon their hearts - so that they understand it not - and deafness in their ears.</p><p>Some people perceive this ayah to contain a sense of coercion in it (on the part of Allaah). So what is your opinion with regards to this?</p><h4>Answer</h4><p> This "placing" is an existential (kawnee) type of placing. In order to
understand this, we must explain the meaning of Allaahs Divine Desire (Iraadah). Divine
Desire is divided into two categories:&nbsp;The <b>Sharee (Legislative)</b> Desire and the <b>Kawnee (Existential)</b> Desire.</p><p>The Legislative Desire is everything that Allaah has legislated for His servants and incited them to do, such as acts of worship and obedience, regardless of their rulings, whether obligatory or recommended. Allaah desires and loves these acts of worship and obedience.</p><p>As for the Existential Desire, it may at times be something that Allaah did not legislate
but yet preordained.</p><p>Everything, according to Allaah, is decreed - it either consists of good or it consists of evil. However, that which applies from it to us is that we look at what we do. The things we do either occur purely from our desire and free choice or they occur in spite of what we desire. Acts of obedience or disobedience do not apply to this second category. It is only the first category that the religious laws revolve around. And it is based on this that a person will be rewarded with either Paradise or the Hellfire. This means that whatever a person does based on his own desire and whatever he chases after through His actions and free choice, this is what he will be held accountable for. If it is good, then he will have good and if it is bad, then he will have bad.</p><p>The fact that a person has a free choice in a large portion of his actions is a fact that cannot be argued with whether religiously or intellectually.</p><p>As for religiously, there are numerous texts from the Quraan and Sunnah that confirm that a person may choose to do what he is ordered to do and abandon what he is forbidden from doing. These texts are too numerous to mention.</p><p>As for intellectually, it is clear to every person that is void of whims and desires that whenever he speaks or walks or eats or drinks or does anything that involves his free will, he is choosing on his own to do that action and not being forced to do that at all.</p><p>The actions of a human being are divided into two categories:</p><ul><li>Those that are done out of his choice and free will</li><li><div>Those that are done as a result of him being forced and coerced to</div></li></ul><p>We have nothing to say about the actions that are done due to coercion - not from a religious perspective or from a real-life perspective. The religion is only concerned with the matters of free choice and free will. This is the truth of the matter. If we implant this into our minds, we will be able to understand the afore-mentioned ayah: "And We placed veils upon their hearts." This refers to the Existential Placing. We must remember that the afore-mentioned ayah: "Verily, His Command - when He desires something" refers to the Existential Desire. However, it is not done against the will and choice of this person whom Allaah has placed veils over his heart.</p><p>Here is an example of this from an actual perspective: When a human being is created, he is formed while his flesh is still soft and tender. Then as he gets older and older, his flesh becomes harder and his bones become stronger. However, not all people are the same in this regard. So lets say for example this person is devoted to (learning) some type of study or science. What part of the body will grow strong in this person? His mind will strengthen. His brain will become stronger in the field that he preoccupies it with and applies all of its abilities on. However, from a physical standpoint, his body will not strengthen nor will his muscles develop.</p><p>This is the same example as someone who lingers in his misguidance, rejection, disbelief and denial and as a result attains this condition of these veils being placed by Allaah over his heart, not because Allaah compelled and forced this upon him but rather due to his actions and free choice.</p><p>So this is the existential placing which these disbelieving people have acquired (for
themselves). They have gotten themselves to this point, which the ignorant think they
were forced into, when in reality, such a fate was not obliged upon them, but rather
came about due to what their own hands earned. And Allaah does not oppress His
servants.</p>
