<h3>The Merit Of Stating The Object Of The Action Before The Doer Of The Act, And The Merit Of These Negations</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:5"></p>
<p>
	"You...", means, we worship You alone and none else, and rely on You alone and none else. This is the perfect form of obedience and the
	entire religion is implied by these two ideas.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:5"></p>
<p>
	The first part is a declaration of innocence from Shirk (polytheism), while the second negates having any power or strength, displaying the
	recognition that all affairs are controlled by Allah alone. We should mention that in this Ayah, the type of speech here changes from the
	third person to direct speech by using the Kaf. This is because after the servant praised and thanked Allah, he stands before Him,
	addressing Him directly.
