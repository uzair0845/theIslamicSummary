<h3>The Faithful Ask For And Abide By Guidance</h3>
<p>
	If someone asks, "Why does the believer ask Allah for guidance during every prayer and at other times, while he is already properly guided
	Has he not already acquired guidance." The answer to these questions is that if it were not a fact that the believer needs to keep asking
	for guidance day and night, Allah would not have directed him to invoke Him to acquire the guidance. The servant needs Allah the Exalted
	every hour of his life to help him remain firm on the path of guidance and to make him even more firm and persistent on it. The servant
	does not have the power to benefit or harm himself, except by Allah's permission.
</p>
<p>Allah commanded His believing servants to proclaim,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="3:8"></p>
<p class="quote">Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower</p>
<p>As for Allah's statement,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:7">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p>
<p>
	Meaning guide us to the straight path, the path of those upon whom you have bestowed Your grace, that is, the people of guidance, sincerity
	and obedience to Allah and His Messengers. They are the people who adhere to Allah's commandments and refrain from committing what He has
	prohibited. But, help us to avoid the path of those whom Allah is angry with, whose intentions are corrupt, who know the truth, yet deviate
	from it.
</p>
<p>
	Also, help us avoid the path of those who were led astray. Allah asserted that the two paths He described here are both misguided when He
	repeated the negation 'not'. These two paths are the paths of the Christians and Jews, a fact that the believer should beware of so that he
	avoids them.
</p>
<p>
	The path of the believers is knowledge of the truth and abiding by it. In comparison, the Jews abandoned practicing the religion, while the
	Christians lost the true knowledge. This is why 'anger' descended upon the Jews, while being described as 'led astray' is more appropriate
	of the Christians. Those who know, but avoid implementing the truth, deserve the anger, unlike those who are ignorant. The Christians want
	to seek the true knowledge, but are unable to find it because they did not seek it from its proper resources.
