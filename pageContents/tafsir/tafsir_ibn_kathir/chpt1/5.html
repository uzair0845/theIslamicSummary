<h3>Explaining This Hadith</h3>
<p>
	The last Hadith used the word 'prayer' in reference to reciting the Qur'an, (Al-Fatihah in this case) just as Allah said in another Ayah,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="17:110">وَلَا تَجْهَرْ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَابْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا</p>
<p class="quote">And offer your Salah neither aloud nor in a low voice, but follow a way between.</p>
<p>
	Also, in the last Hadith, Allah said, "I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, a half for Me and a half
	for My servant. My servant shall have what he asked for." Allah next explained the division that involves reciting Al-Fatihah,
	demonstrating the importance of reciting the Qur'an during the prayer, which is one of the prayer's greatest pillars. Hence, the word
	'prayer' was used here although only a part of it was actually being referred to, that is, reciting the Qur'an.
