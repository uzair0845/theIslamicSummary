<p class="arabic" verse="15:16-18"></p>
<p class="quote"></p>
<p class="quote">
	And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every
	Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.
</p>
<p>
	It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people's
	hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.
