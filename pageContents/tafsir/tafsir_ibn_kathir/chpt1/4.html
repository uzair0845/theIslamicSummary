<p>Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet pbuh said,</p>
<p class="arabic">مَنْ صَلَى صَلَاةً لَمْ يَقْرَأْ فِيهَا أُمَّ الْقُرْآنِ فَهِيَ خِدَاجٌ ثَلَاثًا غَيْرُ تَمَامٍ</p>

<p class="quote">'My servant has glorified Me.' When he says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:4"></p>
<p class="quote">Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic">مَجَّدَنِي عَبْدِي</p>
<p class="quote">'My servant has glorified Me,' or,</p>
<p class="arabic">فَوَّضَ إِلَيَّ عَبْدِي</p>
<p class="quote">'My servant has related all matters to Me.' When he says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:5"></p>
<p class="quote">Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic">هذَا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ</p>
<p class="quote">'This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he sought.' When he says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:6-7"></p>
<p class="quote">Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic">هذَا لِعَبْدِي وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ</p>
<p class="quote">'This is for My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asked for.'</p>
<p>
	These are the words of An-Nasa'i, while both Muslim and An-Nasa'i collected the following wording, "A half of it is for Me and a half for
	My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asked for."
