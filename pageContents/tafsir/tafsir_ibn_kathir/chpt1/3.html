<h3>Virtues Of Al-Fatihah</h3>
<p>
	Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded in the Musnad that Abu Said bin Al-Mualla said, "I was praying when the Prophet pbuh called me, so I did not answer him until I finished the prayer. I then went to him and he said, "What prevented you from coming." I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I was praying.' He said, "Didn't Allah say,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="8:24">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَجِيبُوا لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ</p>
<p class="quote">O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger pbuh when he calls you to that which gives you life.</p>
<p>He then said,</p>
<p class="arabic">لَأُعَلِّمَنَّكَ أَعْظَمَ سُورَةٍ فِي الْقُرْآنِ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَخْرُجَ مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ</p>
<p class="quote">I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an before you leave the Masjid.</p>
<p>
	He held my hand and when he was about to leave the Masjid, I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! You said: I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an.' He said, (Yes)
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="1:2"></p>
<p>
	It is the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given. Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also recorded
	this Hadith.
</p>
<p>
	At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from Ubayy bin Kab who said that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">مَا أَنْزَل اللهُ فِي التَّورَاةِ وَلَا فِي الْإِنْجِيلِ مِثْلَ أُمِّ الْقُرْآنِ وَهِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَهِيَ مَقْسُومَةٌ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ</p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah has never revealed in the Tawrah or the Injil anything similar to Umm Al-Qur'an. It is the seven repeated verses and it is divided
	into two halves between Allah and His servant.
</p>
<p>This is the wording reported by An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p>
	Abu Said Al-Khudri said, "Once, we were on a journey when a female servant came and said, 'The leader of this area has been poisoned and
	our people are away. Is there a healer among you.' Then a man whose healing expertise did not interest us stood for her, he read a Ruqyah
	for him, and he was healed. The chief gave him thirty sheep as a gift and some milk. When he came back to us we said to him, 'You know of a
	(new) Ruqyah, or did you do this before' He said, 'I only used Umm Al-Kitab as Ruqyah.' We said, 'Do not do anything further until we ask
	the Messenger of Allah.' When we went back to Al-Madinah we mentioned what had happened to the Prophet. The Prophet said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">وَمَا كَانَ يُدْرِيهِ أَنَّهَا رُقْيَةٌ اقْسِمُوا وَاضْرِبُوا لِي بِسَهْمٍ</p>
<p class="quote">Who told him that it is a Ruqyah. Divide (the sheep) and reserve a share for me.</p>
<p>
	Ibn Abbas said, "While Jibril was with the Messenger of Allah, he heard a noise from above. Jibril lifted his sight to the sky and said,
	'This is a door in heaven being open, and it has never been opened before now.' An angel descended from that door and came to the Prophet
	pbuh and said, 'Receive the glad tidings of two lights that you have been given, which no other Prophet before you was given: the Opening
	of the Book and the last (three) Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah. You will not read a letter of them, but will gain its benefit.'" This is the
	wording collected by An-Nasa'i. Muslim recorded a similar wording.
