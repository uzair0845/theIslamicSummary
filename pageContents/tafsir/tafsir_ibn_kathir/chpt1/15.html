<h3>The Virtues Of Al-Hamd</h3>
<p>
	Furthermore, Abu Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said
	that Jabir bin Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">أَفْضَلُ الذِّكْرِ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَفْضَلُ الدُّعَاءِ الْحَمْدُ لله</p>
<p class="quote">
	The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.
</p>
<p>At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib. Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,</p>
<p class="arabic">مَا أَنْعَمَ اللهُ عَلَى عَبْدٍ نِعْمَةً فَقَالَ: الْحَمْدُ للهِ، إِلَّا كَانَ الَّذِي أَعْطَى أَفْضَلَ مِمَّا أَخَذَ</p>
<p class="quote">No servant is blessed by Allah and says, 'Al-Hamdu Lillah', except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.</p>
