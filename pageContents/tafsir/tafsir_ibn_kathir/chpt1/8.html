<h3>What Does Isti'adhah Mean</h3>
<p>
	Isti'adhah means, "I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs,
	or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from."
</p>
<p>
	Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind
	with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to
	seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus,
	only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil.

<p>This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:200"></p>
<p class="quote">And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing.</p>
