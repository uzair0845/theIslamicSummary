<h3>The Meaning Of Al-Hamd</h3>
<p>Abu Jafar bin Jarir said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	"The meaning of Al-Hamdu Lillah is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of
	Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah's innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of. Allah's
	bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His
	commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone
	compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal
	dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end."
</p>
<p>Further, Ibn Jarir commented,</p>
<p class="quote">
	A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, 'Say: All
	thanks and praise is due to Allah.'
