<h3>Bismillah Is The First Ayah Of Al-Fatihah</h3>
<p>
	The scholars also agree that Bismillah is a part of an Ayah in Surat An-Naml. They disagree over whether it is a separate Ayah before every
	Surah, or if it is an Ayah, or a part of an Ayah, included in every Surah where the Bismillah appears in its beginning.
</p>
<p>
	The opinion that Bismillah is an Ayah of every Surah, except At-Tawbah (chapter 9), was attributed to Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr,
	Abu Hurayrah and Ali. This opinion was also attributed to the Tabi'in: Ata', Tawus, Said bin Jubayr, Makhul and Az-Zuhri. This is also the
	view of Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, (in one report from him) Ishaq bin Rahwayh and Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin
	Salam.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, Malik, Abu Hanifah and their followers said that Bismillah is not an Ayah in Al-Fatihah or any other Surah. Dawud said
	that it is a separate Ayah in the beginning of every Surah, not part of the Surah itself, and this opinion was also attributed to Ahmad bin
	Hanbal.
