<h3>The Meaning Of Al-Fatihah And Its Various Names</h3>
<p>
	This Surah is called Al-Fatihah, that is, the Opener of the Book, the Surah with which prayers are begun. It is also called, Umm Al-Kitab
	(the Mother of the Book), according to the majority of the scholars. In an authentic Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih,
	Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">الْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبَ الْعَالَمِينَ أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ وَأُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَالسَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p class="quote">
	Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-Alamin is the Mother of the Qur'an, the Mother of the Book, and the seven repeated Ayat of the Glorious Qur'an.
</p>
<p>It is also called Al-Hamd, because the Prophet (PBUH) said that his Lord said,</p>
<p class="arabic">
	قَسَمْتُ الصَّلَاةَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ، فَإِذَا قَالَ الْعَبْدُ:الْحَمْدُ لله رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، قَالَ اللهُ: حَمِدَنِي عَبْدِي
</p>

<p class="quote">
	The prayer (Al-Fatihah) is divided into two halves between Me and My servants.' When the servant says, 'All praise is due to Allah, the
	Lord of existence,' Allah says, 'My servant has praised Me.'
</p>
<p>
	Al-Fatihah was called the Salah, because reciting it is a condition for the correctness of Salah. Al-Fatihah was also called Ash-Shifa'
	(the Cure).
</p>
<p>
	It is also called Ar-Ruqyah (remedy), since in the Sahih, there is the narration of Abu Sa'id telling the the story of the Companion who
	used Al-Fatihah as a remedy for the tribal chief who was poisoned. Later, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to a Companion,
</p>
<p class="arabic">وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّهَا رُقْيَةٌ</p>
<p class="quote">How did you know that it is a Ruqyah</p>
