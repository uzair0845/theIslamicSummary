<h3>Why Is The Creation Called Alam</h3>
<p>Alam is derived from Alamah, that is because it is a sign testifying to the existence of its Creator and to His Oneness."</p>

<p class="quote">
	Allah has described Himself by 'Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim' after saying 'the Lord of the Alamin', so His statement here includes a warning, and
	then an encouragement.
</p>
<p>Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,</p>
<p class="arabic">لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ مَا عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الْعُقُوبَةِ مَا طَمِعَ فِي جَنَّتِهِ أَحَدٌ، وَلَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْكَافِرُ مَا عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ مَا قَنَطَ مِنْ رَحْمَتِهِ أَحَدٌ</p>
<p class="quote">
	If the believer knew what punishment Allah has, none would have hope in acquiring His Paradise, and if the disbeliever knew what mercy
	Allah has, none will lose hope of earning His earning.
