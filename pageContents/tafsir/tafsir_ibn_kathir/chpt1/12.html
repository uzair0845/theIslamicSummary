<h3>Basmalah Aloud In The Prayer</h3>
<p>
	As for Basmalah aloud during the prayer, those who did not agree that it is a part of Al-Fatihah, state that the Basmalah should not be aloud.
</p>
<p>
	The scholars who stated that Bismillah is a part of every Surah (except chapter 9) had different opinions; some of them, such as
	Ash-Shafi'i, said that one should recite Bismillah with Al-Fatihah aloud. This is also the opinion of many among the Companions, the
	Tabi'in and the Imams of Muslims from the Salaf and the later generations. The proof that these scholars relied on is that, since Bismillah
	is a part of Al-Fatihah, it should be recited aloud like the rest of Al-Fatihah. Also, An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan, that Abu Hurayrah
	once performed the prayer and recited Bismillah aloud, and after he finished the prayer, he said, "Among you, I perform the prayer that is the
	closest to the prayer of the Messenger of Allah pbuh."

	Imam Abu Abdullah Ash-Shafi'i and Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, recorded that Muawiyah led the prayer in Al-Madinah and did not recite the
	Bismillah. The Muhajirin who were present at that prayer criticized that. When Mu'awiyah led the following prayer, he recited the Bismillah
	aloud.

<p>
	Imam Malik stated that the Bismillah is not recited aloud or silently. This group based their view upon what Imam Muslim recorded that
	A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah pbuh used to start the prayer by reciting the Takbir (Allahu Akbar; Allah is Greater) and then
	reciting,

<p>
	Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "I prayed behind the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and they used to start
	their prayer with,

<p>Muslim added, "And they did not mention,</p>

<p>whether in the beginning or the end of the recitation."</p>
