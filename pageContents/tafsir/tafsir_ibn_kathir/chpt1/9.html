<h3>Why The Devil Is Called Shaytan</h3>
<p>
	In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind,
	and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally 'burned'),
	because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible.

<p>
	Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, "The Arabs say, 'So-and-so has Tashaytan,' when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan
	was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan)." Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far
	away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a 'Shaytan'. Allah said,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:112">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوًّۭا شَيَٰطِينَ ٱلْإِنسِ وَٱلْجِنِّ يُوحِى بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍۢ زُخْرُفَ ٱلْقَوْلِ غُرُورًۭا</p>
<p class="quote">
	And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies. Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as
	a delusion.
