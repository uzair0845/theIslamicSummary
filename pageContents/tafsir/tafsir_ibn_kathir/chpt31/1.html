<p class="quote">
    Alif Lam Mim. These are Ayat of the Wise Book. A guide and a mercy for the Muhsinin. Those who perform the Salah and give Zakah and they have faith in the Hereafter with certainty. Such are on guidance from their Lord, and such are the successful.

    Allah has made the Qur'an a guidance and healing and a mercy for the Muhsinin, who are those who do good deeds in accordance with the Shari'ah. They establish the obligatory prayers in the proper manner and at the correct times, and follow that with regular, optional and supererogatory prayers; they pay the Zakah to those who deserve it; they uphold the ties of kinship with their relatives; they have certain faith that there will be rewards and punishments in the Hereafter, and they seek the reward with Allah; they do not show off or seek a reward or thanks from other people. Whoever does this is one of those of whom Allah says:

<p class="arabic" verse="31:5">أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًۭى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ</p>
<p>meaning, they follow His guidance with clear understanding.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="31:5">وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ</p>
<p>in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
