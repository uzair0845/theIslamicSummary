<h3>How Amr bin Al-As Was Aware Of The Qur'an's Miracle Due To This Surah</h3>
<p>
	Amr bin Al-As went to visit Musaylimah Al-Kadhdhab after the Messenger of Allah pbuh was commissioned (as a Prophet) and before Amr had
	accepted Islam. Upon his arrival, Musaylimah said to him, "What has been revealed to your friend (Muhammad pbuh) during this time" Amr
	said, "A short and concise Surah has been revealed to him." Musaylimah then said, "What is it?" Amr replied:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="103:1-3"></p>
<p>
	So Musaylimah thought for a while. Then he said, "Indeed something similar has also been revealed to me." Amr asked him, "What is it?" He
	replied, "O Wabr, O Wabr! You are only two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is digging and burrowing." Then he said, "What do you
	think, O Amr?" So Amr said to him, "By Allah! Verily, you know that I know you are lying." The Wabr is a small animal that resembles a cat,
	and the largest thing on it is its ears and its torso, while the rest of it is ugly.
</p>
<p>
	Musaylimah intended by the composition of these nonsensical verses to produce something which would oppose the Qur'an. Yet, it was not even
	convincing to the idol worshipper of that time.
</p>
<p>Ash-Shafi'i said, "If the people were to ponder on this Surah, it would be sufficient for them."</p>
