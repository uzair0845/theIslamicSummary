<h3>Al-Asr Is The Time In Which The Movements Of The Children Of Adam Occur, Whether Good Or Evil</h3>
<p>
	Al-Asr is the time in which the movements of the Children of Adam occur, whether good or evil. Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam that he
	said, "It is the evening." However, the first view is the popular opinion. Thus, Allah swears by this, that man is in Khusr, which means in
	loss and destruction.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="103:2"></p>
<p>
	So Allah makes an exception, among the species of man being in loss, for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with
	their limbs.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="103:3">وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p>This is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="103:3">وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالصَّبْرِ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, with the plots, the evils, and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from
	evil.
