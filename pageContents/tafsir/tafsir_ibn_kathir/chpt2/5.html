<p>The Book, is the Qur'an, and Rayb means doubt. As-Suddi said that Abu Malik and Abu Salih narrated from Ibn Abbas, and Murrah Al-Hamadani narrated from Ibn Masud and several other Companions of the Messenger of Allah pbuh that,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:2'>لَا رَيۡبَ‌ۛ فِيهِ‌ۛ</p>
<p class='quote'>In which there is no Rayb</p>
<p>means about which there is no doubt. Some scholars stated that this Ayah - 2:2 - contains a prohibition meaning, "Do not doubt the Qur'an."</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of the reciters of the Qur'an pause upon reading "لَا رَيۡبَ‌ۛ", and they then continue "فِيهِ‌ۛ هُدً۬ى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ". However, it is better to pause at لَا رَيۡبَ‌ۛ فِيهِ‌ۛ, because in this case "هُدً۬ى" becomes an attribute of the Qur'an and carries a better meaning than "فِيهِ‌ۛ هُدً۬ى".</p>
