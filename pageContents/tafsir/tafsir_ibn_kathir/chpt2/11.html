<p>As for the meaning of Ghayb here, the Salaf have different explanations of it, all of which are correct, indicating the same general meaning.</p>
<p>Jafar Ar-Razi quoted Ar-Rabi bin Anas, reporting from Abu Al-Aliyah about Allah's statement:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:3'>يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱلۡغَيۡبِ</p>
<p class='quote'>(Those who) have faith in the Ghayb</p>
<p>"They believe in Allah, His angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, His Paradise, Fire and in the meeting with Him. They also believe in life after death and in Resurrection. All of this is the Ghayb."</p>
<p>Sa'id bin Mansur reported from Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid who said:</p>
<p class='quote'>We were sitting with Abdullah bin Masud when we mentioned the Companions of the Prophet and their deeds being superior to our deeds. Abdullah said: 'The matter of Muhammad was clear for those who saw him. By He other than Whom there is no God, no person will ever acquire a better type of faith than believing in Al-Ghayb.'</p>
