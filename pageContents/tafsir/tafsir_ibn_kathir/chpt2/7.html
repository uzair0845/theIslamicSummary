<p>Ibn Abbas said about:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse="2:2">هُدً۬ى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>guidance for the Muttaqin</p>
<p>
    that it means, "They are the believers who avoid Shirk with Allah and who work in His obedience." Ibn Abbas also said that Al-Muttaqin means, "Those who fear Allah's punishment, which would result if they abandoned the true guidance that they recognize and know. They also hope in Allah's mercy by believing in what He revealed."

<p>At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrated that Atiyah As-Sadi said that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>لَا يَبْلُغُ الْعَبْدُ أَنْ يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ حَتَّى يَدَعَ مَالَا بَأْسَ بِهِ حَذَرًا مِمَّا بِهِ بَأْس</p>
<p class='quote'>The servant will not acquire the status of the Muttaqin until he abandons what is harmless out of fear of falling into that which is harmful.</p>
