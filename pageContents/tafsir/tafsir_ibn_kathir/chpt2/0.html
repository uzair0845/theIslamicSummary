<h3>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h3>
<p>In Musnad Ahmad, Sahih Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>لَا تَجْعَلُوا بُيُوتَكُمْ قُبُورًا فَإِنَّ الْبَيْتَ الَّذِي تُقْرَأُ فِيهِ سُورَةُ الْبَقَرَةِ لَا يَدْخُلُهُ الشَّيْطَان</p>
<p class='quote'>Do not turn your houses into graves. Verily, Shaytan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited</p>
<p>Also, Abdullah bin Masud said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Shaytan flees from the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is heard.</p>
<p>Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash-Shabi said that Abdullah bin Masud said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Shaytan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (255), the following two Ayat (256-257) and the last three Ayat.</p>
<p>Further, Sahl bin Sad said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ سَنَامًا، وَإِنَّ سَنَامَ الْقُرْآنِ الْبَقَرَةُ، وَإِنَّ مَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ لَيْلَةً لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَ لَيَالٍ، وَمَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ نَهَارًا لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّام</p>
<p class='quote'>Everything has a hump (or, high peek), and Al-Baqarah is the high peek of the Qur'an. Whoever recites Al-Baqarah at night in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three nights. Whoever recites it during a day in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three days.</p>
<p>At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The Messenger of Allah pbuh sent an expedition force comprising of many men and asked each about what they memorized of the Qur'an. The Prophet pbuh came to one of the youngest men among them and asked him, 'What have you memorized (of the Qur'an) young man' He said, 'I memorized such and such Surahs and also Al-Baqarah.' The Prophet pbuh said, 'You memorized Surat Al-Baqarah?' He said, 'Yes.' The Prophet pbuh said, 'Then you are their commander.' One of the noted men (or chiefs) commented, 'By Allah! I did not learn Surat Al-Baqarah, for fear that I would not be able to implement it.' The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>تَعَلَّمُوا القُرْآنَ وَاقْرَءُوهُ، فَإِنَّ مَثَلَ الْقُرْآنِ لِمَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَقَرَأَ وَقَامَ بِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ مَحْشُوَ مِسْكًا يَفُوحُ رِيحُهُ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ، وَمَثَلُ مَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَيَرْقُدُ وَهُوَ فِي جَوْفِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ أُوكِيَ عَلى مِسْك</p>
<p class="quote">"Learn Al-Qur'an and recite it, for the example of whoever learns the Qur'an, recites it and adheres to it, is the example of a bag that is full of musk whose scent fills the air. The example of whoever learns the Qur'an and then sleeps (i.e. lazy) while the Qur'an is in his memory, is the example of a bag that has musk, but is closed tight."</p>
