<p>Ibn Jarir said:</p>
<p class='quote'>The hypocrites commit mischief on earth by disobeying their Lord on it and continuing in the prohibited acts. They also abandon what Allah made obligatory and doubt His religion, even though He does not accept a deed from anyone except with faith in His religion and certainty of its truth. The hypocrites also lie to the believers by saying contrary to the doubt and hesitation their hearts harbor. They give as much aid as they can, against Allah's loyal friends, and support those who deny Allah, His Books and His Messengers. This is how the hypocrites commit mischief on earth, while thinking that they are doing righteous work on earth.</p>
<p>The statement by Ibn Jarir is true, taking the disbelievers as friends is one of the categories of mischief on the
earth. Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='8:73'>وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعۡضُہُمۡ أَوۡلِيَآءُ بَعۡضٍ‌ۚ إِلَّا تَفۡعَلُوهُ تَكُن فِتۡنَةٌ۬ فِى ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَفَسَادٌ۬ ڪَبِيرٌ۬</p>
<p class='quote'>And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, if you do not do this (help each other), there will be turmoil and oppression on the earth, and great mischief.</p>
<p>In this way Allah severed the loyalty between the believers and the disbelievers. Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='4:144'>يَـٰٓأَيُّہَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلۡكَـٰفِرِينَ أَوۡلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ‌ۚ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ عَلَيۡڪُمۡ سُلۡطَـٰنً۬ا مُّبِينًا</p>
<p class='quote'>O you who believe! Do not take disbelievers as Awliya' (protectors or helpers or friends) instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest proof against yourselves?</p>
<p>Allah then said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='4:145'>إِنَّ ٱلۡمُنَـٰفِقِينَ فِى ٱلدَّرۡكِ ٱلۡأَسۡفَلِ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمۡ نَصِيرًا</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth of the Fire; no helper will you find for them</p>
<p>Since the outward appearance of the hypocrite displays belief, he confuses the true believers. Hence, the deceitful
behavior of the hypocrites is an act of mischief, because they deceive the believers by claiming what they do not
believe in, and because they give support and loyalty to the disbelievers against the believers.</p>
<p>If the hypocrite remains a disbeliever (rather than pretending to be Muslim), the evil that results from him would be less. Even better, if the hypocrite becomes sincere with Allah and makes the statements that he utters conform to his deeds, he will gain success. Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:11'></p>
<p class='quote'>And when it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."</p>
<p>meaning, "We seek to be friends with both parties, the believers and the disbelievers, and to have peace with both
parties." Similarly, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn Abbas said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:11'></p>
<p class='quote'>And when it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."
</p>
<p>means, "We seek to make amends between the believers and the People of the Book."</p>
<p>Allah said that if the hypocrites are told:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:13'>ءَامِنُواْ كَمَآ ءَامَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ</p>
<p class='quote'>"Believe as the people believe,"</p>
<p>meaning, 'Believe just as the believers believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, Resurrection after
death, Paradise and Hellfire, etc. And obey Allah and His Messenger by heeding the commandments and avoiding the
prohibitions.' Yet the hypocrites answer by saying, "Shall we believe as the fools have believed" they meant (may Allah curse the hypocrites) the Companions of the Messenger of Allah. This is the same Tafsir given by Abu Al-Aliyah and As-Suddi in his Tafsir, with a chain of narration to Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud and other Companions. This is also the Tafsir of Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. The hypocrites said, "Us and them having the same status, following the same path, while they are fools!" 'The fool' is the ignorant, simple-minded person who has little knowledge in areas of benefit and harm. This is why, according to the majority of the scholars, Allah used the term foolish to include children, when He said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='4:5'>وَلَا تُؤۡتُواْ ٱلسُّفَهَآءَ أَمۡوَٲلَكُمُ ٱلَّتِى جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمۡ قِيَـٰمً۬ا</p>
<p class='quote'>And do not give your property, which Allah has made a means of support for you, to the foolish.</p>
<p>Allah answered the hypocrites in all of these instances. For instance, Allah said here:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:13'>أَلَآ إِنَّهُمۡ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, they are the fools</p>
<p>Allah thus affirmed that the hypocrites are indeed the fools, yet,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:13'>وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَعۡلَمُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>But they know not</p>
<p>Since they are so thoroughly ignorant, the hypocrites are unaware of their degree of deviation and ignorance, and such situation is more dangerous, a severer case of blindness, and further from the truth than one who is aware.</p>
