<p>Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:15'></p>
<p class='quote'>Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly</p>
<p>As-Suddi reported that Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud and several other Companions of the Messenger of Allah said that:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:15'>وَيَمُدُّهُمۡ</p>
<p class='quote'>and leaves them increasing</p>
<p>means, He gives them respite. Also, Mujahid said, "He (causes their deviation) to increase."</p>
<p>Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='6:110'></p>
<p class='quote'>And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe in it the first time, and
We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly</p>
<p>Tughyan used in this Ayah means to transgress the limits, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='69:11'></p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, when the water Tagha (rose) beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship</p>
<p>In his Tafsir, As-Suddi reported that Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masud commented on:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:16'>أُوْلَـٰٓٮِٕكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشۡتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلۡهُدَىٰ</p>
<p class='quote'>These are they who have purchased error with guidance</p>
<p>saying it means, "They pursued misguidance and abandoned guidance." Mujahid said, "They believed and then disbelieved," while Qatadah said, "They preferred deviation to guidance."</p>
