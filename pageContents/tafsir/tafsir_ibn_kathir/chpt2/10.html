In this case, fear of Allah is included in the general meaning of Iman, which necessitates following deeds of the tongue by implementation. Hence, Iman is a general term that includes affirming and believing in Allah, His Books and His Messengers, and realizing this affirmation through adhering to the implications of what the tongue utters and affirms.</p>
<p>Linguistically, in the absolute sense, Iman merely means trust. However, when Iman is used in an unrestricted manner, it includes beliefs, deeds, and statements of the tongue. We should state here that Iman increases and decreases. Some scholars explained that Iman means Khashyah (fear of Allah).</p>
<p>Fear is the core of Iman and knowledge.</p>
