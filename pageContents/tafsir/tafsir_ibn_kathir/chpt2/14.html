<p class='arabic' verse='2:4'></p>
<p class='quote'>And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you, and in the Hereafter they are certain.</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said that:</p>
<p class='quote'>(And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you.) means, "They believe in what Allah sent you with, and in what the previous Messengers were sent with, they do not distinguish between (believing) them, nor do they reject what they brought from their Lord."</p>
<p class='quote'>(And in the Hereafter they are certain) that is the resurrection, the standing (on the Day of Resurrection), Paradise, the Fire, the reckoning and the Scale that weighs the deeds (the Mizan). The Hereafter is so named because it comes after this earthly life.</p>
