<p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said:</p>
<p class='quote'>Every characteristic that Allah describes those other than the people of Islam - such as being losers - then it refers to disbelief. However, when they are attributed to the people of Islam, then these terms refer to sin.</p>
<p>Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:27'>أُوْلَـٰٓٮِٕكَ هُمُ ٱلۡخَـٰسِرُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>It is they who are the losers</p>
<p class='quote'>Losers is plural for loser, this word refers to whoever decreased his own share of Allah's mercy by disobeying Him, just as the merchant loses in his trade by sustaining capital loss. Such is the case with the hypocrite and the disbeliever who lose their share of the mercy that Allah has in store for His servants on the Day of Resurrection. And that is when the disbeliever and the hypocrite most desperately need Allah's mercy.</p>
<p> Ibn Jarir reported from Ata' that Ibn Abbas said that</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:28'>وَڪُنتُمۡ أَمۡوَٲتً۬ا فَأَحۡيَـٰڪُمۡ‌ۖ</p>
<p class='quote'>Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life</p>
<p class="quote">means "You did not exist beforehand. You were nothing until Allah created you; He will bring death to you and then bring you back to life during Resurrection."</p>
