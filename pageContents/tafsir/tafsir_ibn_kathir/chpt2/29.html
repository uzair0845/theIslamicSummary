<p class='arabic' verse='2:19'>كَصَيِّبٍ۬</p>
<p class='quote'>Like a Sayyib</p>
<p>meaning, "The rain", as Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, and several other Companions have confirmed. Ad-Dahhak said "It is the clouds." However, the most accepted opinion is that it means
the rain that comes down during,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:19'>ظُلُمَـٰتٌ۬</p>
<p class='quote'>darkness</p>
<p>meaning, here, the doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:19'>وَرَعۡدٌ۬</p>
<p class='quote'>thunder</p>
<p>that shocks the hearts with fear. The hypocrites are usually full of fear and anxiety, just as Allah described
them:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='63:4'>يَحۡسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيۡحَةٍ عَلَيۡہِمۡ‌ۚ</p>
<p class='quote'>They think that every cry is against them</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:19'>ٱلۡبَرۡقَ</p>
<p class='quote'>The lightning</p>
<p>is in reference to the light of faith that is sometimes felt in the hearts of the hypocrites,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:19'>يَجۡعَلُونَ أَصَـٰبِعَهُمۡ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِہِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٲعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلۡمَوۡتِ‌ۚ وَٱللَّهُ مُحِيطُۢ بِٱلۡكَـٰفِرِينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever
encompasses the disbelievers.</p>
<p>meaning, their cautiousness does not benefit them because they are bound by Allah's all-encompassing will and decision.</p>
<p>Allah then said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:20'>يَكَادُ ٱلۡبَرۡقُ يَخۡطَفُ أَبۡصَـٰرَهُمۡ</p>
<p class='quote'>The lightning almost snatches away their sight</p>
<p>meaning, because the lightning is strong itself, and because their comprehension is weak and does not allow them to embrace the faith.</p>
<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas
commented on the Ayah:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:20'>يَكَادُ ٱلۡبَرۡقُ يَخۡطَفُ أَبۡصَـٰرَهُمۡ‌ۖ</p>
<p class='quote'>The lightning almost snatches away their sight</p>
<p class='quote'>The Qur'an mentioned almost all of the secrets of the hypocrites.</p>
<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah also narrated that Ibn Abbas said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:20'>كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوۡاْ فِيهِ</p>
<p class='quote'>Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein</p>
<p class="quote">Whenever the hypocrites acquire a share in the victories of Islam, they are content with this share. Whenever Islam suffers a calamity, they are ready to revert to disbelief.</p>
<p>Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn Abbas said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:20'>كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوۡاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظۡلَمَ عَلَيۡہِمۡ قَامُواْ‌ۚ</p>
<p class='quote'>Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still</p>
<p class="quote">They recognize the truth and speak about it. So their speech is upright, but when they revert to disbeleif, they again fall into confusion.</p>
