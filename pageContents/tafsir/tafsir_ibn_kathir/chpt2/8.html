<p>Huda here means the faith that resides in the heart, and only Allah is able to create it in the heart of the servants. Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='28:56'>إِنَّكَ لَا تَہۡدِى مَنۡ أَحۡبَبۡتَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='18:17'>مَن يَہۡدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلۡمُهۡتَدِ‌ۖ وَمَن يُضۡلِلۡ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ ۥ وَلِيًّ۬ا مُّرۡشِدً۬ا</p>
<p class='quote'>He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right path)</p>
<p>Huda also means to explain the truth, give direction and lead to it. Allah, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='42:52'>وَإِنَّكَ لَتَہۡدِىٓ إِلَىٰ صِرَٲطٍ۬ مُّسۡتَقِيمٍ۬</p>
<p class='quote'>And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path (i.e. Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)</p>
<p>Also, Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='90:10'>وَهَدَيۡنَـٰهُ ٱلنَّجۡدَيۡنِ</p>
<p class='quote'>And shown him the two ways (good and evil).</p>
<p>This is the view of the scholars who said that the two ways refer to the paths of righteousness and evil, which is also the correct explanation. And Allah knows best.</p>
