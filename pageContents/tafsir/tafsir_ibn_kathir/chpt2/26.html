<p>Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:14'>قَالُوٓاْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمۡ</p>
<p class='quote'>They say: "Truly, we are with you"</p>
<p>Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn Abbas said that the Ayah means:</p>
<p class='quote'>We are with you,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:14'>إِنَّمَا نَحۡنُ مُسۡتَہۡزِءُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>(Verily, we were but mocking), meaning, we only mock people (the believers) and deceive them.</p>
<p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said that the Ayah:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:14'>إِنَّمَا نَحۡنُ مُسۡتَہۡزِءُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, we were but mocking</p>
<p>means, "We (meaning the hypocrites) were mocking the Companions of Muhammad."</p>

<p>Allah's statement:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:15'></p>
<p class='quote'>Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly</p>

<p>answers the hypocrites and punishes them for their behavior. Ibn Jarir commented, "Allah mentioned what He will do to them on the Day of Resurrection, when He said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='57:13'></p>
<p class='quote'>On the Day when the hypocrites - men and women - will say to the believers: "Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!" It will be said: "Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='3:178'></p>
<p class='quote'>And let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing of their punishment is good for them. We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness.</p>
<p>He then said, "This, and its like, is Allah's mockery of the hypocrites and the people of Shirk."</p>
