<p>Allah stated the virtue of Adam above the angels, because He taught Adam, rather than them, the names of everything. This occurred after they prostrated to him. This discussion precedes that event here, only to show the importance of his position, and the absence of the angels. knowledge about creating the Khalifah when they asked about it. So Allah informed the angels that He knows what they do not know, and then He mentioned this to show them Adam's superiority over them in knowledge. Allah said,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:31'>وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</p>
<p class='quote'>And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)</p>
<p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas commented on the Ayah:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:31'>وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</p>
<p class='quote'>And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), "Meaning, the names that people use, such as human, animal, sky, earth, land, sea, horse, donkey, and so forth, including the names of the other species."</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:31'>فَقَالَ أَنۢبِـُٔونِى بِأَسۡمَآءِ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِن كُنتُمۡ صَـٰدِقِينَ</p>
<p class='quote'>And said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful"</p>
<p>Allah said, "If you say the truth, that if I appoint a non-angel Khalifah on the earth, he and his offspring will disobey Me, commit mischief and shed blood, but if I designate you the Khalifahs you will obey Me, follow My command and honor and glorify Me. However, since you do not know the names of the objects I paraded before you, then you have even less knowledge of what will occur on the earth that does not exist yet."</p>
