<p>Allah revealed the characteristics of the hypocrites, so that the believers would not be deceived by their outer appearance, thus saving the believers from a great evil. Otherwise, the believers might think that the hypocrites were believers, when in reality they are disbelievers. To consider the sinners as righteous people is extremely dangerous, Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:8'></p>
<p class='quote'>And of mankind, there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day" while in fact they do not believe.</p>
<p>Meaning, they utter these false statements only with their tongues, just as Allah said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='63:1'>إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلۡمُنَـٰفِقُونَ قَالُواْ نَشۡہَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ‌ۗ وَٱللَّهُ يَعۡلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ</p>
<p class="quote">When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad) , they say: "We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah." Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger</p>
<p>This Ayah means that the hypocrites utter these statements only when they meet you, not because they actually believe what they are saying. The hypocrites emphasize their belief in Allah and the Last Day with their words, when that is not the case in reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, Allah stated that the hypocrites lie in their testimony of creed, when He said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='63:1'>وَٱللَّهُ يَشۡہَدُ إِنَّ ٱلۡمُنَـٰفِقِينَ لَكَـٰذِبُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.</p>
<p>Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn Jurayj commented on Allah's statement,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='4:142'>إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يُخَٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَٰدِعُهُمْ</p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them</p>
<p class="quote">The hypocrites pronounce, 'There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah' seeking to ensure the sanctity of their blood and money, all the while concealing disbelief.</p>
