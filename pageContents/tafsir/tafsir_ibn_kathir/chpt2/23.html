<p>In his Tafsir, As-Suddi said that Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masud commented,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:11'>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمۡ لَا تُفۡسِدُواْ فِى ٱلۡأَرۡضِ قَالُوٓاْ إِنَّمَا نَحۡنُ مُصۡلِحُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>And when it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."</p>
<p  class='quote'>They are the hypocrites. As for,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:11'>لَا تُفۡسِدُواْ فِى ٱلۡأَرۡضِ</p>
<p class='quote'>Do not make mischief on the earth</p>
<p class='quote'>that is disbelief and acts of disobedience.</p>
<p>Abu Jafar said that Ar-Rabi bin Anas said that Abu Al-Aliyah said that Allah's statement:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='2:11'>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمۡ لَا تُفۡسِدُواْ فِى ٱلۡأَرۡضِ</p>
<p class='quote'>And when it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on the earth,"</p>
<p>means, "Do not commit acts of disobedience on the earth. Their mischief is disobeying Allah, because whoever disobeys Allah on the earth, or commands that Allah be disobeyed, he has committed mischief on the earth. Peace on both the earth and in the heavens is ensured (and earned) through obedience (to Allah)." Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Qatadah said similarly.</p>
