<h3>Which Was Revealed In Al-Madinah And They Also Say In Makkah</h3>
<p>
	Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, all recorded from Anas that he said, "While we were with the Messenger of Allah in the Masjid, he dozed
	off into a slumber. Then he lifted his head smiling. We said, 'O Messenger of Allah! What has caused you to laugh?' He said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">لَقَدْ أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَيَّ آنِفًا سُورَة</p>
<p class="quote">
	Verily, a Surah was just revealed to me.
</p>
<p>Then he pbuh recited:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="108:1-3"></p>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<p class="arabic">أَتَدْرُونَ مَا الْكَوْثَرُ</p>
<p class="quote">Do you all know what is Al-Kawthar?</p>
<p>We said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p>
<p class="arabic">فَإِنَّهُ نَهَرٌ وَعَدَنِيهِ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ،عَلَيْهِ خَيْرٌ كَثِيرٌ، هُوَ حَوْضٌ تَرِدُ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، آنِيَتُهُ عَدَدُ النُّجُومِ فِي السَّمَاءِ، فَيُخْتَلَجُ الْعَبْدُ مِنْهُمْ فَأَقُولُ: رَبِّ إِنَّهُ مِنْ أُمَّتِي، فَيَقُولُ: إِنَّكَ لَا تَدْرِي مَا أَحْدَثَ بَعْدَك</p>
<p class="quote">
	Verily, it is a river that my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has promised me and it has abundant goodness. It is a pond where my Ummah will
	be brought to on the Day of Judgement. Its containers are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Then a servant of Allah from among them will
	be (prevented from it) and I will say: "O Lord! Verily, he is from my Ummah (followers)." Then He (Allah) will say: "Verily, you do not know
	what he introduced (or innovated) after you."
</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,</p>
<p class="arabic">دَخَلْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَإِذَا أَنَا بِنَهْرٍ حَافَتَاهُ خِيَامُ اللُّؤْلُؤِ، فَضَرَبْتُ بِيَدِي إِلَى مَا يَجْرِي فِيهِ الْمَاءُ، فَإِذَا مِسْكٌ أَذْفَرُ، قُلْتُ: مَاهَذَا يَا جِبْرِيلُ؟ قَالَ: هَذَا الْكَوْثَرُ الَّذِي أَعْطَاكَهُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل</p>
<p class="quote">
	I entered Paradise and I came to a river whose banks had tents made of pearls. So I thrust my hand into its flowing water and found that it
	was the strongest (smell) of musk. So I asked, "O Jibril! What is this'' He replied, "This is Al-Kawthar which Allah, the Mighty and
	Majestic has given you."
</p>
<p>Ahmad recorded from Anas that a man said, "O Messenger of Allah! What is Al-Kawthar?" He replied,</p>
<p class="arabic">هُوَ نَهْرٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَعْطَانِيهِ رَبِّي، لَهُوَ أَشَدُّ بَيَاضًا مِنَ اللَّبَنِ، وَأَحْلَى مِنَ الْعَسَلِ، فِيهِ طُيُورٌ أَعْنَاقُهَا كَأَعْنَاقِ الْجُزُر</p>
<p class="quote">
	It is a river in Paradise which my Lord has given me. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. There are birds in it whose necks are
	(long) like carrots.</p>
<p>Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah! Verily, they (the birds) will be beautiful." The Prophet pbuh replied,</p>
<p class="arabic">آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا يَا عُمَر</p>
<p class="quote">The one who eats them (i.e., the people of Paradise) will be more beautiful than them, O Umar.</p>
<p>
	Al-Bukhari also recorded from Said bin Jubayr that Ibn Abbas said, "Al-Kawthar is the abundant goodness." This explanation includes the
	river and other things as well. Because the word Al-Kawthar comes from the word Kathrah (abundance) and it (Al-Kawthar) linguistically
	means an abundance of goodness. So from this goodness is the river (in Paradise).
</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><p class="arabic">الْكَوْثَرُ نَهْرٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ حَافَتَاهُ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ، وَالْمَاءُ يَجْرِي عَلَى اللُّؤْلُؤِ، وَمَاؤُهُ أَشَدُّ بَيَاضًا مِنَ اللَّبَنِ، وَأَحْلَى مِنَ الْعَسَل</p><p class="quote">Al-Kawthar is a river in Paradise whose banks are of gold and it runs over pearls. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.</p>
