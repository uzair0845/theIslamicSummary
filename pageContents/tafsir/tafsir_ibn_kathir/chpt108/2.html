<h3>The Enemy Of The Prophet (PBUH) Is Cut Off</h3>
<p>
	Allah says,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="108:3"></p>
<p>
	Meaning, 'Indeed he who hates you, O Muhammad pbuh, and he hates what you have come with of guidance, truth, clear proof and manifest light, he
	is the most cut off, meanest, lowliest person who will not be remembered.'
</p>
<p>
	Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Said bin Jubayr and Qatadah all said, "This Ayah was revealed about Al-As bin Wa'il. Whenever the Messenger of Allah
	would be mentioned (in his presence) he would say, 'Leave him, for indeed he is a man who is cut off having no descendants. So when he dies
	he will not be remembered.' Therefore, Allah revealed this Surah."

	Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn Abbas said, "Kab bin Al-Ashraf came to Makkah and the Quraysh said to him, 'You are the leader of them (the

	the idolators and said, 'Muhammad has been cut off (i.e., from progeny) tonight.' So concerning this Allah revealed,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="108:3"></p>
<p>So they thought in their ignorance that if his sons died, his remembrance would be cut off. Allah forbid! To the contrary, Allah preserved his remembrance for all the world to see, and He obligated all the servants to follow his Law. This will continue for all of time until the Day of Gathering and the coming of the Hereafter. May the blessings of Allah and His peace be upon him forever until the Day of Assembling.</p>
