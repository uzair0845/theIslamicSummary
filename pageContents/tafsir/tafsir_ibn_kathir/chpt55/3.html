<p>They move in their orbit in perfect succession, according to precise calculation that is never delayed nor disturbed.</p>

<p>Ibn Jarir commented,</p>
<p class="quote">
	Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the meaning of Allah's statement, 'And the Najm.' They agreed, however, that the trees mentioned here are those that stand on trunks."
</p>
<p>
	Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, "An-Najm refers to the plants that lay on the ground." Similar was said by Sa'id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi and Sufyan Ath-Thawri. This is what Ibn Jarir preferred, may Allah have mercy upon him. Mujahid said, "An-Najm (the star); the one that is in the sky." Al-Hasan and Qatadah said similarly.

<p class="arabic" verse="55:7"></p>
<p>meaning the justice.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:9"></p>
<p>meaning, do not cheat in the weights and measures, but rather observe justice and fairness.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:10"></p>
<p>Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Al-An'am means the creatures.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:11"></p>
<p>
	Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn Abbas said that Al-Akmam means sheathed fruit stalks. Similar was said by more than one of the scholars of
	Tafsir, it refers to the stalks that the seeds grow in to become a cluster of dates, unripe green dates then they ripen and ripen more.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:12"></p>
<p>
	Asf means straw. Al-Awfi reported from Ibn Abbas, "Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called Asf when it dries out."
	Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that Asf means straw. Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while
	Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves.
