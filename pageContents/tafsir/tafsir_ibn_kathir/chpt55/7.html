<h3>Allah Created Different Types Of Water</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:19"></p>
<p>
	(He has Maraja the two seas), or let them loose, according to Ibn Abbas. Ibn Zayd said, "He prevents them from meeting by the dividing
	barrier He placed between them to separate them." The two seas are the fresh and salty waters, the former coming from running rivers.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:20"></p>
<p>
	Meaning, He has placed a barrier of land between these two types of waters, so that they do not transgress upon each other, which would
	spoil the characteristics they were created with.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:22"></p>
<p>As for Marjan they say it means small pearls.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:24">وَلَهُ الْجَوَارِ الْمُنشَئاتُ فِي الْبَحْرِ</p>
<p>
	Mujahid said, "Whatever ship hoists a sail, it is from Munsha'at, if it does not hoist a sail, it is not from the Munsha'at." Qatadah said,
	"Al-Munsha'at means created." Others said that it is Al-Munshi'at meaning, "launched."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:24">كَالاٌّعْلَـمِ</p>
<p>This means, they are like mountains with their great size, and it also refers to the trade and commercial services they make possible.</p>
