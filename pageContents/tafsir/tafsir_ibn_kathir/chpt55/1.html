<h3>The Introduction To Surat Ar-Rahman</h3>
<p>
	Imam Ahmad recorded that Zirr said that a man said to Ibn Mas'ud: "How is this recited: Ma'in Ghayri Yasin or Asin" He asked him, "Are you
	that proficient in reciting the whole Qur'an" He replied, "I recite the Mufassal section in one Rak'ah." So he said, "Woe to you! Do you
	recite the Qur'an in haste, as if it is poetry I know that the Prophet used to recite two Surahs from the beginning of the Mufassal section
	(in one Rak'ah)." And Ibn Mas'ud considered Surat Ar-Rahman to be the beginning of the Mufassal section.

	Abu 'Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Jabir said, "The Messenger of Allah pbuh went to his Companions and recited Surat Ar-Rahman from beginning to
	end for them, but they did not say anything. The Prophet pbuh said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">لَقَدْ قَرَأْتُهَا عَلَى الْجِنِّ لَيْلَةَ الْجِنِّ فَكَانُوا أَحْسَنَ مَرْدُودًا مِنْكُمْ، كُنْتُ كُلَّمَا أَتَيْتُ عَلَى قَوْلِهِ:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:13"></p>
<p class="arabic">قَالُوا: لَا بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ نِعَمِكَ رَبَّنَا نُكَذِّبُ فَلَكَ الْحَمْد</p>
<p class="quote">
	I recited it to the Jinns, on the night of the Jinns and their response was better than yours! Whenever I recited Allah's statement: (Then
	which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny), they said, "None of Your favors do we deny, our Lord! All praise is due to you."
</p>
<p>
	At-Tirmidhi recorded it and he said, "This Hadith is Gharib." Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar also collected this Hadith.
