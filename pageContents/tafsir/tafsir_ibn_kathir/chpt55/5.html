<h3>The Creation Of Humans And Jinns</h3>
<p>
	Allah mentions that He created mankind from clay, like that used in pottery, and created the Jinns from the tip of the flame of a smokeless
	fire. This was said by Ad-Dahhak from Ibn Abbas. It was also said by Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. Al-Awfi reported from Ibn
	Abbas, "From the best part of the fire, from its smokeless flame." Imam Ahmad recorded that A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger pbuh said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">خُلِقَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ نُورٍ، وَخُلِقَ الْجَانُّ مِنْ مَارِجٍ مِنْ نَارٍ، وَخُلِقَ آدَمُ مِمَّا وُصِفَ لَكُم</p>
<p class="quote">The angels were created from light, the Jinns from a smokeless flame of fire, and Adam from what was described to you.</p>
