<p class="arabic" verse="55:37">فَكَانَتْ وَرْدَةً كَالدِّهَانِ</p>
<p>
	This means they will melt just as sediment and silver are melted when heated. And they will be colored, just as dies stain something, sometimes red, sometimes yellow, or blue, or green. This demonstrates the extent of the horrors of the Mighty Day of Resurrection. As-Suddi said, "It will be as rosy color and as filth oil." Mujahid said: "Like the colors of dyes."

<p class="arabic" verse="55:39"></p>
<p>
	This is the case at the time, then all the creatures will be questioned about their deeds. Qatadah said, "On that they will be questioned and then their mouths will be sealed and their hands and feet will reveal what they used to do."

<p class="arabic" verse="55:41">يُعْرَفُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ بِسِيمَـهُمْ</p>

'An' meaning hot, due to the fierce and intense heat that is impossible to bear. Ibn Abbas said, "That has reached the ultimate temperature and boiling fiercely."
