<h3>Ar-Rahman Revealed And Taught The Qur'an</h3>
<p>
	Allah informs of His favors and His mercy for His creatures, for He revealed the Qur'an to His servants, He made memorizing and
	understanding of it easy for those on whom He has bestowed His mercy,

<p>
	Al-Hasan said: "Eloquent speech." This refers to Allah teaching the Qur'an, that is, teaching the servants how to recite it by making it
	easy for them to speak and pronounce letters with the various parts of the mouth, such as the alveolar bridge, the tongue and the lips.
