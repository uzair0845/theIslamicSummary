<h3>Allah Is The Ever Living, Free Of All Need</h3>
<p>
	Allah states that all the residents of earth will perish and die. The residents of the heavens will die, except whomever Allah wills. Only
	Allah's Honorable Face will remain, because our Lord, the Exalted, the Blessed, is the Ever Living Who never dies. Qatadah said, "First,
	Allah mentioned His creatures and then He said that all of this will perish." Ash-Sha'bi said, "When you have recited,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:26"></p>
<p>do not stop, continue reading,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:27"></p>
<p>Allah said,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:29"></p>
<p>
	In this Ayah, Allah affirms that He is Rich, Free of all wants for anyone else and that all creatures stand in need of Him, in all
	conditions and situations. They all seek His help willingly or unwillingly. Everyday, He is engaged in some affair.
