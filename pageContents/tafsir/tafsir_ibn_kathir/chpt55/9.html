<p>Ibn Jurayj said that the Ayah,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:31">سَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ</p>
<p>
	means, 'We shall judge you,' while Al-Bukhari said that it means, "We shall recompense you. Surely, nothing will busy Allah from attending
	to anything else." This type of speech pattern is common in the Arabic language. For example, one would say, "I will attend to you," even
	when one is not busy with anything else.

<p>Refers to the humans and the Jinns,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:35"></p>
<p>
	Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas that Shuwaz is the flame of fire. Abu Salih said, "It is the flame above the fire below the
	smoke."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:35">وَنُحَاسٌ</p>
<p>
	Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas, "the smoke of the fire." Similar was reported from Abu Salih, Said bin Jubayr and Abu Sinan.
	Ibn Jarir said that the Arabs used to call the smoke of the fire, Nuhas and Nihas. But he said that the scholars of Qur'anic recitation
	said that in this Ayah, the word recited is Nuhas. Mujahid said, "Molten brass poured over their heads." Qatadah held the same view.
	Ad-Dahhak said, "Nuhas is liquid copper." The Ayah means, if you, mankind and the Jinns, try to escape on the Day of Resurrection, then the
	angels, including those among them who guard Hellfire, will bring you back by directing smoke of fire and molten brass on you.'
