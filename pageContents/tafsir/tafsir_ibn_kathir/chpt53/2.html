    Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad brought to people was taught to him by "شديد القوى", and he is Jibreel, as Allah said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="81:19-20"></p>
<p class="quote">Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="53:6">ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p>
<p>meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. Ibn Abbas said: He has a good look. Qatada said: He is tall and has a good look.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="53:6">فَاسْتَوَى</p>
<p>This refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="53:7"></p>
<p>
    meaning, Jibril rose to the "الأفق الأعلى", according to Ikrimah and several others; Ikrimah said, "الأفق الأعلى is where the morning comes from." Mujahid said, "It is (the place of) sunrise." Qatadah said, "That from which the day comes." Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly.
</p>

<p>Imam Ahmad recorded a narration of Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p class="arabic">سأل النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم جبريل أن يراه في صورته، فقال : ادع ربك. فدعا ربه – عز وجل – فطلع عليه سواد من قبل المشرق، فجعل يرتفع وينتشر، فلما رآه النبي – صلى الله عليه وسلم – صعق، فأتاه فبعشه، ومسح البزاق عن شدقه</p>
<p class="quote">
    The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, "Invoke your Lord." The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="53:9"></p>
<p class="quote">And was at a distance of two bows length or less</p>
<p>
    means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center.
</p>
<p>Allah's statement "أَوْ أَدْنَى" indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more.</p>

<p>Muslim recorded from Ibn Abbas about:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="53:11"></p>
<p>and,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="53:13"></p>
<p>He said: "He saw Allah twice in his heart."</p>

<p>
    Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah , 'Have you seen your Lord?' He said: "How can I see Him since there was a light?"<sup></sup>
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="53:13-15"></p>
<p>
    This was the second time when Jibreel saw the messenger of Allah pbuh in his original form, and that was the night of Isra. The Messenger of Allah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت</p>
<p class="quote">
    I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Imam Ahmad recorded that:</p>
<p class="arabic">
    عن عبد الله – هو ابن مسعود – قال: لما آسري برسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم انتهي به إلى سدرة المنتهى، وهي في السماء السابعة، إليها ينتهي ما يعرج به من الأرض فيقبض منها، وإليها ينتهي ما يهبط به من فوقها فيقبض منها ، "إذ يغشى السدرة ما يخشى"، قال: فراش من ذهب. قال: وأعطي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ثلاث: أعطي الصلوات الخمس، وأعطي خواتيم سورة البقرة، وغفر لمن لا يشرك بالله شيئًا من أمته المقحمات.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there, "إذ يغشى السدرة ما يخشى," He (the narrator) said, "Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah, and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Ishaq said that Muhammad said:</p>
<p class="arabic">أظنه عن ابن مسعود – أنه قال: إن محمدًا لم ير جبريل في صورته إلا مرتين، أما مرة فإنه سأله أن يريه نفسه في صورته، فأراه صورته فسد الأفق. وأما الأخرى فإنه ضعد معه حين صعد به. وقوله: "وهو بالأفق الأعلى. ثم دنا فتدلى. فكان قاب قوسين أو أدنى. فأوحى إلى عبده ما أوحى." قال: فلما أحس جبريل ربه – عز وجل – عاد في صورته وسجد، فقوله: "ولقد رآه نزلة أخرى. عند سدرة المنتهى. عندها جنة المأوى. إذ يفشي السدرة ما ينشئ. ما زاغ البصر وما طغى. لقد رأى من آيات ربه الكبرى،" قال: خلق جبريل عليه السلام
</p>

    I think it was narrted from Ibn Masood that he said: "Muhammad (pbuh) did not see Jibreel in his original form except in two cases, the first time was when he pbuh asked him to show himself in his original form, so he showed his original form and he filled the horizon; the second time was when he pbuh ascended with him (to the heavens). Allah said: [وهو بالأفق الأعلى، ثم دنا فتدلى، فكان قاب قوسين أو أدنى، فأوحى إلى عبده ما أوحى]." He said: "When Jibreel came close to his Lord, he went back to his original form and prostated; Allah says: [ولقد رآه نزلة أخرى، عند سدرة المنتهى، عندها جنة المأوى، إذ يفشي السدرة ما ينشئ، ما زاغ البصر وما طغى، لقد رأى من آيات ربه الكبرى]." He (Ibn Masood) said: "Jibreel's real form."<sup></sup>
