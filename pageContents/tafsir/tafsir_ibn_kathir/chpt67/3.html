<h3>The Description Of Hell And Those Who Will Enter Into It</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:7">إِذَآ أُلْقُواْ فِيهَا سَمِعُواْ لَهَا شَهِيقًا</p>
<p>Ibn Jarir said, "This means the sound of shouting."</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:7">وَهِىَ تَفُورُ</p>
<p class="quote">While it is simmering</p>
<p>Ath-Thawri said, "It will boil them just as a small number of seeds are boiled in a lot of water."</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:8">تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ</p>
<p class="quote">It almost bursts up with fury</p>
<p>Meaning, some parts of it almost break apart from other parts due to the severity of its rage and anger with them.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:10"></p>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Al-Bakhtari At-Ta'i that he heard from one of the Companions that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,</p>
<p class="arabic">لَنْ يَهْلِكَ النَّاسُ حَتْى يُعْذِرُوا مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِم</p>
<p class="quote">The people will not be destroyed until they themselves confess their guilt.</p>
