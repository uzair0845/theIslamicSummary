<h3>Allah's Favor Of Subjugating The Earth To His Servants</h3>
<p>Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:15">هُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ ذَلُولاً فَامْشُواْ فِى مَنَاكِبِهَا</p>
<p>
	Meaning, travel wherever you wish throughout its regions and frequent its countrysides and all the areas of its domain in your various
	journeys to seek earnings and trade. And know that your efforts will not benefit you anything unless Allah makes matters easy for you.
	Allah continues to say,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:15">وَكُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِهِ</p>
<p>
	Thus, striving by using the means (to attain something) does not negate the necessity of depending upon Allah (At-Tawakkul). This is
	similar to what Imam Ahmad recorded from Umar bin Al-Khattab, that he heard the Messenger of Allah pbuh say,
</p>
<p class="arabic">لَوْأَنَّكُمْ تَتَوَكَّلُونَ عَلَى اللهِ حَقَّ تَوَكُّلِهِ، لَرَزَقَكُمْ كَمَا يَرْزُقُ الطَّيْرَ، تَغْدُو خِمَاصًا وَتَرُوحُ بِطَانًا</p>
<p class="quote">
	If you would trust in Allah as He truly should be trusted in, He would surely provide for you as He provides for the birds. They set out in
	the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full stomachs.
</p>
<p>At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah all recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih."</p>
