<h3>The Virtues Of Surat Al-Mulk</h3>
<p>
	Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that Allah's Messenger pbuh said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">إِنَّ سُورَةً فِي الْقُرْآنِ ثَلَاثِينَ آيَةً شَفَعَتْ لِصَاحِبِهَا حَتْى غُفِرَ لَهُ:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:1">تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ</p>
<p class="quote">
	Verily, there is a chapter in the Qur'an which contains thirty Ayat that will intercede on behalf of its reciter until he is forgiven. (It
	is): Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion.
</p>
<p>
	This Hadith was collected by At-Tirmidhi and the four Sunan Compilers. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, "This is a Hasan Hadith."
</p>
<p>
	At-Tabarani and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' Al-Maqdisi both recorded from Anas that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">سُورَةٌ فِي الْقُرْآنِ خَاصَمَتْ عَنْ صَاحِبِهَا حَتْى أَدْخَلَتْهُ الْجَنَّةَ:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:1">تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ</p>
<p class="quote">
	There is a chapter of the Qur'an that will argue on behalf of its reciter until it causes him to enter into Paradise. (It is): Blessed be
	He in Whose Hand is the dominion.
