<h3>The Parable Of The Disbeliever And The Believer</h3>
<p>Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:22"></p>
<p>
	This is a parable which Allah made of the believer and the disbeliever. So the condition of the disbeliever is like one who walks prone on
	his face. This is like a person walking bent over on his face (with his head down) instead of walking upright. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas
	bin Malik that it was said, "O Messenger of Allah! How will the people be gathered on their faces?" So the Prophet pbuh replied,
</p>
<p class="arabic">أَلَيْسَ الَّذِي أَمْشَاهُمْ عَلَى أَرْجُلِهِمْ قَادِرًا عَلَى أَنْ يُمْشِيَهُمْ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِم</p>
<p class="quote">Is not He who made them to walk on their legs able to make them walk on their faces.</p>
<p>This Hadith is also recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>
