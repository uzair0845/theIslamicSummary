<h3>No One Will Help You And No One Can Grant Sustenance Except For Allah</h3>
<p>Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:20">أَمَّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ جُندٌ لَّكُمْ يَنصُرُكُمْ مِّن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p>
<p>Meaning, there is no protector or helper for you besides Him. This is the reason that Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:20">إِنِ الْكَـفِرُونَ إِلاَّ فِى غُرُورٍ</p>
<p>Then Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:21">أَمَّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, who is it that can provide for you if Allah cuts off your sustenance There is no one who gives, withholds, creates, provides and
	helps other than Allah alone, Who has no partner. This proves that they know this, yet they still worship others besides Him. Thus, Allah
	says,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:21">بَل لَّجُّواْ</p>
<p>Meaning, they persist in their transgression, lying and misguidance.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:21">فِى عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ</p>
<p class="quote">to be in pride, and flee</p>
<p>Meaning, they continue in obstinance, arrogance and fleeing away from the truth. They do not listen to it nor do they follow it.</p>
