<h3>Glorification Of Allah And Mentioning The Creation Of Death, Life, the Heavens And the Stars</h3>
<p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:2">لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً</p>
<p>
	It means best in deeds. This is as Muhammad bin Ajlan said that it should be noted that Allah did not say "which of you does the most deeds."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:3">الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقًا</p>
<p>
	Meaning stacked one on top of the other. Are they connected to each other, meaning that they are in elevated ascension, some of them being
	stacked above others, or separated with space between them There are two views concerning this, and the most correct opinion seems to be
	the latter as is proven in the Hadith of Isra'.
</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Ath-Thawri and others said concerning Allah's statement,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:3">فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَى مِن فُطُورٍ</p>
<p>
	That it means cracks. As-Suddi said that it means any tears. Qatadah said that it means, 'do you see any defects O Son of Adam (mankind)?'
	In reference to Allah's statement,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:4">ثُمَّ اْرجِعِ البَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ</p>
<p>Qatadah said, "It means (look) twice."</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:4">يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ البَصَرُ خَاسِئًا</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said that Khasi' means humiliated. Mujahid and Qatadah both said that it means despised.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:4">وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ</p>
<p>
	Ibn Abbas said that this means it will be exhausted. Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi all said that it means broken down fatigue that comes
	from weakness.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:5">وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُومًۭا لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ</p>
<p>
	This refers to the stars which have been placed in the heavens, some moving and some stationary. The pronoun 'them' in His statement, "and
	We have made them" is the same type of statement as the stars being referred to as lamps. This does not mean that they are actually
	missiles, because the stars in the sky are not thrown. Rather, it is the meteors beneath them that are thrown and they are taken from the stars.
</p>
<p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:5">وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ</p>
<p>
	Means, 'We have made this disgrace for the devils in this life and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire in the Hereafter.'
</p>
<p>
	Qatadah said, "These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven (sky), as missiles for the
	devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has
	spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of." Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi
	Hatim both recorded this statement.
