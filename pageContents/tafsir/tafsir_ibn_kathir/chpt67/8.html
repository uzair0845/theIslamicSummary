<h3>Allah's Power to create And It Being An Evidence Of The Final Abode</h3>
<p>Allah says,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:23">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْسَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ وَالأَفْئِدَةَ</p>
<p class="quote">and endowed you with hearing and seeing, and hearts.</p>
<p>Meaning, intellects and powers of reasoning.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:23">قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, how little you use these abilities that Allah has blessed you with to obey Him, to act according to His commandments, and avoid
	His prohibitions.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:24">قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, He has spread and distributed you all througout the various regions and areas of the earth with your differing languages, colors,
	shapes, appearances and forms.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="67:24">وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, you all will come together after this separation and division. He will gather you all just as He separated you and He will bring
	you back again just as He originated you.
