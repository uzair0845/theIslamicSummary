<p class="arabic" verse="51:24-25"></p>
<p>
    The three angels: Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil came to Ibrahim in the image of handsome young wonderfully graceful men. This is why Ibrahim said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:25">قَوْمٌ مُّنكَرُونَ</p>

<p>Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:26">فراغ إلى أهله</p>
<p>meaning Ibrahim discretely went inside in haste.</p>
<p>The scholars of Tafsir have two opinions about this:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:26">فجاء بعجل سمين</p>
<p>
    meaning from the best of his menu, and in another Ayah:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="11:69">فَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍۢ</p>
<p class="quote">And he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:27">فَقَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ</p>
<p>meaning brought it close to them.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:27">فَقَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ</p>
<p class="quote">Saying, "Will you not eat?"</p>
<p>
    Ibrahim said this polite and kind statement to his guests, and surely, this Ayah indicates proper manners for honoring guests. For he brought the food to his guests quickly, while they were unaware that it was being prepared for them. He did not first mention this favor to them by saying, "We will make food for you." Rather, he discretely had it prepared and placed before them. He prepared the best kind of food he had, a young, fat roasted calf. He did not place the food far from them and invite them to come close to it to eat. Rather, he placed it close to them and refrained from ordering them to eat, instead he invited them using a kind and subtle invitation.
</p>

<p>Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:28">فَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً</p>
<p class="quote">Then he conceived fear of them.</p>
<p>This Ayah is explained by Allah's statement:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="11:70-71">فَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً قَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّا أُرْسِلْنَا إِلَى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ وَامْرَأَتُهُ قَآئِمَةٌ فَضَحِكَتْ</p>
<p class="quote">
    But when he saw their hands went not towards it, he mistrusted them, and felt a sense of fear of them. They said: "Fear not, we have been sent against the people of Lut." And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed.
</p>
<p>
    meaning, she was glad that the people of Lut would be destroyed on account of their rebellion and transgression against Allah, the Exalted. This is when the angels delivered the good news to her of a son, Ishaq, and Yaqub after Ishaq.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="11:72-73"></p>
<p class="quote">
    She said: "Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man Verily, this is a strange thing!" They said, "Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O family of the house. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious."
</p>
<p>Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:28">وبشروه بغلام عليم</p>
<p class="quote">And they gave him glad tidings of a son having knowledge.</p>

<p>Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:29">فَأَقْبَلَتِ امْرَأَتُهُ فِى صَرَّةٍ</p>
<p class="quote">Then his wife came forward with a loud voice.</p>
<p>
    She screamed loudly, according to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, Ath-Thawri and As-Suddi. She said when she shouted,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="25:28">يوَيْلَتَا</p>
<p class="quote">Ah! Woe to me!</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:29">فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا</p>
<p class="quote">She smote her face.</p>
<p>
    meaning, she struck herself upon her forehead, according to Mujahid and Ibn Sabit. Ibn Abbas said that she smacked her face just as women do when confronted with an amazing thing.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:30"></p>
<p class="quote">They said: "Even so says your Lord. Verily, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower''</p>
<p>
    He is the All-Knower of the honor that you are worthy of and He is the most Wise in His statements and decisions.
