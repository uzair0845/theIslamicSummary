<p class="arabic" verse="51:16">ءَاخِذِينَ مَآ ءَاتَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ</p>
<p class="quote">Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them.</p>
<p>
    His statement "ءَاخِذِينَ" describes the state of the people of Taqwa in the midst of gardens and springs. They will receive what their Lord gives them, meaning, delight, happiness and favors.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:16">إنهم كانوا قبل ذلك مُحْسِنِينَ</p>
<p class="quote">Verily, they were before that gooddoers</p>
<p>
    meaning, in the life of the world.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:17"></p>
<p class="quote">They used to sleep but little at night.</p>
<p>The scholars of Tafsir have two opinions about this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>The first is that, they used to spend a little part of every night awake. Mujahid said:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic">قَل ما يرقدون ليلة حتى الصباح لا يتهجدون</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            Only a few nights, if any, would they sleep through the night until the morning without praying Tahajjud.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Second Opinion They used to spend a little part of the night in sleep. This was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said:
        </div>
        <div class="bulletArabic">كابدوا قيام الليل ، فلا ينامون من الليل إلا أقله ، ونشطوا فمدّوا إلى السحر ، حتى كان الاستغفار بسحر</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            They performed voluntary night prayer and would not sleep during the night except a little. They were active and would continue until they were seeking forgiveness right before dawn.
        </div>
        <div>Mamar said concerning Allah's statement "كانوا قليلاً من الليل ما يهجعون":</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic">كان الزهري والحسن يقولان : كانوا كثيرًا من الليل ما يصلون</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            As-Zuhri and Al-Hasan used to say: "They spent most of their night in worhsip."
        </div>
        <div>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic">إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ غُرَفًا يُرَى ظَاهِرُهَا مِنْ بَاطِنِهَا وَبَاطِنُهَا مِنْ ظَاهِرِهَا</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            Verily, there are lofty rooms in Paradise in which their outside can be seen from inside and their inside from the outside.
        </div>
        <div>Abu Musa Al-Ashari said, "Who are they for, O Allah's Messenger" He said:</div>
        <div class="bulletArabic">لِمَنْ أَلَانَ الْكَلَامَ، وَأَطْعَمَ الطَّعَامَ، وَبَاتَ للهِ قَائِمًا وَالنَّاسُ نِيَام</div>
        <div class="bulletQuote">
            For those who use soft speech, feed food and spend the night in voluntary prayer while people are asleep.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>As for Allah's statement:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:18"></p>
<p class="quote">And in the hours before dawn, they were asking for forgiveness</p>
<p>
    Mujahid and several others said: "They were performing Salah." Others said that they would stand in prayer during the night and delayed asking Allah for forgiveness until the latter hours before dawn. It is better if asking for forgiveness is done while praying.
</p>
<p>
    It is confirmed in the Sahih collections as well as others, from several Companions, that the Messenger of Allah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَنْزِلُ كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى سَمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ الْأَخِيرُ، فَيَقُولُ: هَلْ مِنْ تَائِبٍ فَأَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِ. هَلْ مِنْ مُسْتَغْفِرٍ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ. هَلْ مِنْ سَائِلٍ فَيُعْطَى سُؤْلَهُ؟ حَتْى يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْر</p>
<p class="quote">
    Allah, the Most High, descends each night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains. He says, "Is there anyone who is repenting so that I may accept his repentance? Is there anyone seeking forgiveness, so that I may forgive him? Is there anyone asking of Me, so that I may grant him his request?" until Fajr begins.<sup></sup>
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:19"></p>
<p>
    After Allah mentioned their quality of performing prayer, He then mentioned their quality of spending in charity and acts of compassion and kindness.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="51:19">وَفِى أَمْوَلِهِمْ حَقٌّ</p>
<p>
    A designated part which they dedicated to the Sa'il and Mahrum. The Sa'il is the poor who begs others, and he has a due right. As for the Mahrum, Ibn Abbas and Mujahid said, "He is the poor person who does not receive a stipend." Meaning he does not receive a stipend from the Muslim treasury, nor does he have a means of income, nor a profession. The Mother of the faithful, A'ishah may Allah be pleased with her, said about the Mahrum, "He is the displaced, the one who does not have a profession to easily earn an income from." Qatadah and Az-Zuhri: "The Mahrum is the one who does not ask the people for anything." Az-Zuhri added that the Messenger of Allah said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِالطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّهُ اللُّقْمَةُ وَاللُّقْمَتَانِ وَالتَّمْرَةُ وَالتَّمْرَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنًى يُغْنِيهِ وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْه</p>
<p class="quote">
    The poor (Miskin) is not the one who goes round to the people and asks them for a mouthful or two or a date or two. But the poor is the one who does not have enough to satisfy his needs and whose condition is not known to others, so that others may give him something in charity.
</p>
<p>This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs using another chain of narration.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:20"></p>
<p>
    Allah says that there are signs on earth that testify to the might of the Creator and His boundless ability. These signs include what Allah placed on the earth, the various plants, animals, valleys, mountains, deserts, rivers and oceans.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:22"></p>
<p class="quote">And in the heaven is your provision and that which you are promised.</p>
<p>
    "وَفِى السَّمَآءِ رِزْقُكُمْ" means rain, and "وَمَا تُوعَدُونَ" means Paradise, this was said by Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and several others.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:23"></p>
<p class="quote">Then by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is the truth, just as you can speak.</p>
<p>
    Allah is swearing by His honorable Self, all of the matters of the Judgement, Resurrection, and Recompense that they have been promised shall certainly occur. Therefore, it is the truth, there being no doubt about it, so do not doubt its coming, just as you do not doubt that you can speak.
