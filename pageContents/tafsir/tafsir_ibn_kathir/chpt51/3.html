<p class="arabic" verse="51:8"></p>
<p class="quote">Certainly, you have different ideas.</p>
<p>
    Allah says, "you disbelievers who deny the Messengers have different and confused opinions that do not connect or conform to each other." Qatadah said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">إنكم لفي قول مختلف، ما بين مصدق بالقرآن ومكذب به</p>
<p class="quote">
    You have different ideas about the Qur'an. Some of you agree that it is true while some others deny this fact.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:9"></p>
<p class="quote">Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.</p>
<p>
    Allah says, these confused and different opinions only fool those who are inwardly misguided. Surely, such falsehood is accepted, embraced and it becomes the source of confusion only for those who are misguided and originally liars, the fools who have no sound comprehension. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and As-Suddi said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">يضل عنه من ضل</p>
<p class="quote">He who is misguided is led astray from it.</p>
<p>Al-Hasan Al-Basari said:</p>
<p class="arabic">يصرف عن هذا القرآن من كذب به</p>
<p class="quote">The one who turns away from the Quran is the one who lied about it.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:10"></p>
<p>Mujahid said:</p>
<p class="arabic">الكذابون. قال: وهي مثل التي في عباس: "و قتل الإنسان ما أكفره" والخراصون الذين يقولون: لا نبعث ولا يوقنون.</p>
<p class="quote">
    The liars. This is similar to what is mentioned in (Surah) Abasa: "Be cursed man! How ungrateful he is!" Al-Kharrasun are those who claim that they will never be brought back to life, doubting the coming of Resurrection.
</p>
<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas: "Cursed be the doubters."</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:11"></p>
<p class="quote">Who are under a cover of Sahun</p>
<p>
    Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said; "In disbelief and doubt, they are heedless and playful."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:12-13"></p>
<p class="quote">They ask: "When will be the Day of Ad-Din". (It will be) a Day when they will be Yuftanun in the Fire!</p>
<p>
    Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and several others said that Yuftanun means punished. Mujahid said: "Just as gold is forged in the fire." A group of others also including Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Zayd bin Aslam, and Sufyan Ath-Thawri said, "They will be burnt."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:14"></p>
<p class="quote">Taste you your trial!</p>
<p>Mujahid said, "Your burning" while others said, "Your punishment."</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="51:14"></p>
<p class="quote">This is what you used to ask to be hastened!</p>
<p>This will be said admonishing, chastising, humiliating and belittling them.</p>
