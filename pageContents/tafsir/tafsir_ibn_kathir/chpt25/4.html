    Allah tells us about what will happen on the Day of Resurrection, when those whom the idolators used to worship instead of Allah, angels and others, will rebuke them. Allah says:
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:17'>وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ</p>
<p class='quote'>
    And on the Day when He will gather them together and that which they worship besides Allah.
</p>
<p>Mujahid said, "This means Isa, Uzayr and the angels."</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:17'>فَيَقُولُ أَءَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِى هَـؤُلاَءِ</p>
<p class='quote'>He will say: "Was it you who misled these My servants..."</p>
<p>
    Allah will say to those who were worshipped: 'Did you call these people to worship you instead of Me, or was it their own idea to worship you, without any call to that on your part'
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:18'>قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ مَا كَانَ يَنبَغِي لَنَا أَن نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَاءَ</p>
<p class='quote'>
    They will say: "Glorified be You! It was not for us to take (Nattakhidh) any Awliya' besides You for us to take (Nattakhidh) any Awliya' besides You,"
</p>
<p>
    meaning, 'it is not right for any created being, neither us nor them, to worship anyone except You; we did not call them to do that, but they did it of their own accord, without us telling them to do it or accepting what they did. We are innocent of them and their worship.'
</p>
<p>
    Other scholars understand this phrase to mean: 'it is not proper for us to take anyone except You as protectors or helpers (Awliya'),' meaning, 'it is not proper for anyone to worship us, for we are Your servants and in need of You.' This meaning is close to the first.
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:18'>وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً بُوراً</p>
<p>
    Ibn 'Abbas said, "This means, they were destroyed." Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Malik narrated from Az-Zuhri: "There was no good in them."
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:19'>وَمَن يَظْلِم مِّنكُمْ</p>
<p class='quote'>And whoever among you does wrong</p>
<p>means by associating others in worship with Allah.</p>
