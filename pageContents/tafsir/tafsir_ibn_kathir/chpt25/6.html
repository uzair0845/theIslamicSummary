<p>Allah describes how stubborn the disbelievers were in their disbelief when they said:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:21'>لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ</p>
<p class='quote'>Why are not the angels sent down to us,</p>
<p>
    meaning, 'so that we may see them with our own eyes and they may tell us that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah' Allah said:
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:21'>لَقَدِ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْ عُتُوًّۭا كَبِيرًۭا</p>
<p class='quote'>Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:22'></p>
<p class='quote'>
    On the Day they will see the angels, no good news will there be for the criminals that day. And they will say: "Hijran Mahjura."
</p>
<p>
    means, when they do see the angels, it will not be a good day for them, for on that day there will be no good news for them. This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, "Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke." It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='8:50'>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰٓ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ ۙ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَٰرَهُمْ</p>
<p class='quote'>
    And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs.
</p>
<p>
    This is in contrast to the state of the believers when death approaches them, for they are given glad tidings of joy and delight. According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): "Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry."
</p>
<p>Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:22'>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</p>
<p class='quote'>On the Day they will see the angels, no good news</p>
<p>
    refers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:22'>وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p>
<p class='quote'>And they (angels) will say: "Hijran Mahjura."</p>
<p>
    The angels will say to the disbelievers: 'success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition. The pronoun in the phrase:

</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:22'>وَيَقُولُونَ</p>
<p>
    refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Atiyyah Al-Awfi, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say: "حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً". Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:23'>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</p>
<p class='quote'>And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did</p>
<p>
    This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari'ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted.

    Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Abu Ishaq, from Al-Harith that Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on Allah's saying:
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:23'>فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p>
<p class='quote'>and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.</p>
<p>
    "The rays of the sun when they pass through a small aperture." A similar view was also narrated through a different chain of narrators from Ali. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "This refers to the rays coming through a small window, and if anyone tries to grasp them, he cannot." Abu Al-Ahwas narrated from Abu Ishaq from Al-Harith that Ali said: "Haba' refers to the dust raised by animals." Qatadah said: "Have you not seen dry trees when they are blown by the wind This refers to those leaves." It was narrated that Ya`la bin Ubayd said: "Ashes or dust when it is stirred up by the wind."
