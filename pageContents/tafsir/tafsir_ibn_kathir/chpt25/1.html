<p>Here Allah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="25:1">تَبَارَكَ</p>
<p class="quote">Blessed be He</p>
<p>The verbal form used here implies an ongoing, permanent, eternal blessing.</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='25:1'>الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Who sent down the criterion</p>
<p>The verb Nazzala is a form which implies something done a great deal and often.</p>
<p>
    This Surah was named Al-Furqan, because it is the criterion that decides between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, right and wrong, lawful and unlawful. Each of the previous Books was sent down at one time, but the Qur'an was revealed gradually, in stages, Ayat after Ayat, rulings after rulings, Surahs after Surahs.
</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='25:1'>عَلَى عَبْدِهِ</p>
<p>
    This description is one of praise and commendation, because here Allah is connecting him to Himself, describing him as His servant.
</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='25:1'>لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً</p>
<p class='quote'>that he may be a warner to all nations</p>
<p>means, he alone has been blessed with this great, detailed, clear Book.</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='25:2'>الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِى المُلْكِ</p>
<p class='quote'>He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion.</p>
<p>Allah states that He is above having any offspring or partner. Then He tells us:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='25:2'>خَـلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍفَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p>
<p class='quote'>He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.</p>
