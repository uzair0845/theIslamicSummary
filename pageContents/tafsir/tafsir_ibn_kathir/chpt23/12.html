<p>
    Allah tells us of His justice towards His servants in this world, in that He does not task any person except according to his capacity, i.e., He does not burden any soul with more than it can bear. On the Day of Resurrection He will call them to account for their deeds, which He has recorded in a written Book from which nothing is omitted. He says:
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:62'>وَلَدَيْنَا كِتَابٌ يَنطِقُ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p class='quote'>and with Us is a Record which speaks the truth</p>
<p>meaning, the Book of deeds.</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:62'>وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>and they will not be wronged</p>
<p>
    means, nothing will be omitted from their record of good deeds. As for evil deeds, He will forgive and overlook many of them in the case of His believing servants. Then Allah says, denouncing the disbelievers and idolators of the Quraysh:
</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:63'>بَلْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فِى غَمْرَةٍ</p>
<p class='quote'>Nay, but their hearts are covered</p>
<p>meaning because of negligence and misguidance.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:63'>مِّنْ هَـذَا</p>
<p class='quote'>from this</p>
<p>means, the Qur'an which Allah revealed to His Messenger.</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:63'>وَلَهُمْ أَعْمَـلٌ مِّن دُونِ ذَلِكَ هُمْ لَهَا عَـمِلُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>and they have other deeds, besides which they are doing</p>
<p>Al-Hakam bin Aban narrated from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn Abbas that</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:63'>وَلَهُمْ أَعْمَـلٌ</p>
<p>means, evil deeds apart from that, i.e., Shirk,</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:63'>هُمْ لَهَا عَـمِلُونَ</p>
<p>means, which they will inevitably do.</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:64'></p>
<p class='quote'>
    Until when We seize those of them who lead a luxurious life with punishment; behold, they make humble invocation with a loud voice.
</p>
<p>
    means, when the punishment and vengeance of Allah comes to those who are living a happy life of luxury in this world and overtakes them.
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:64'>إِذَا هُمْ يَجْـَٔرُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>behold, they make humble invocation with a loud voice</p>
<p>means, they scream their calls for help</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:65'></p>
<p class='quote'>Invoke not loudly this day! Certainly you shall not be helped by Us.</p>
<p>
    means, no one is going to save you from what has happened to you, whether you scream aloud or remain silent.
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:66'>قَدْ كَانَتْ ءَايَـتِى تُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Indeed My Ayat used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels.</p>
<p>meaning, when you were called, you refused and resisted.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:67'></p>
<p class='quote'>In pride, talking evil about it by night</p>
<p>
    An-Nasa'i said in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sunan: Ahmad bin Sulayman told us that Ubaydullah told us from Isra'il, from Abdul-A'la that he heard Sa'id bin Jubayr narrating that Ibn Abbas said:
</p>
<p class='quote'>Talking by late night became disapproved of when this Ayah was revealed:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:67'></p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    They boasted about the Ka'bah and said, 'We are its people who stay up talking at night.' They used to boast and stay up and talk at night around the Ka'bah. They did not use it for the proper purpose, and so in effect they had abandoned it.
