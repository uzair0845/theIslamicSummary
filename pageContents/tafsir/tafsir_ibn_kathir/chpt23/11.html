<p class='arabic' verse='23:57'></p>
<p class='quote'>Verily, those who live in awe for fear of their Lord</p>
<p>
    means, even though they have reached the level of Ihsan and have faith and do righteous deeds, they are still in awe of Allah and fear Him and His hidden plans for them, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "The believer combines Ihsan with awe, while the disbelievers combine evil deeds with a sense of security."
</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:60'></p>
<p class='quote'>
    And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to return to their Lord.
</p>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from 'A'ishah:</p>
<p class='quote'>I said: "O Messenger of Allah pbuh:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:60'>وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ ءاتَواْ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ</p>
<p class='quote'>
    Are these the ones who steal and commit Zina and drink alcohol while fearing Allah?" The Messenger of Allah replied:
</p>
<p class='arabic'>لَا، يَا بِنْتَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُ الَّذِي يُصَلِّي وَيَصُومُ وَيَتَصَدَّقُ وَهُوَ يَخَافُ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَل</p>
<p class='quote'>
    No, O daughter of Abu Bakr. O daughter of As-Siddiq, the one who prays, fast and gives in charity, fearing Allah.
</p>
<p>This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi.and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded something similar in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>لَا يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُمُ الَّذِينَ يُصَلُّونَ وَيَصُومُونَ وَيَتَصَدَّقُونَ وَهُمْ يَخَافُونَ أَلَّا يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ:</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:61'>أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِى ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ</p>
<p class='quote'>No, O daughter of As-Siddiq, they are the ones who pray and fast and give in charity while fearing that it will not be accepted from them, "It is these who hasten in the good deeds."</p>
