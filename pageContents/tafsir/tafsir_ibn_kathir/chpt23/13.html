<p class='arabic' verse='23:68'>أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا۟ ٱلْقَوْلَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Have they not pondered over the Word?</p>
<p>Qatadah said:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    Because, by Allah, if the people had pondered the meaning and understood it properly, they would have found in the Qur'an a deterrent to disobeying Allah. But they only paid attention to the Ayat which are not entirely clear, and so they were destroyed because of that.

<p class='arabic' verse='23:70'>أَمْ يَقُولُونَ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ</p>
<p class='quote'>Or they say: There is madness in him?</p>
<p>
    This is a narration of what the Quraysh said about the Prophet pbuh. They said that he was making up the Qur'an by himself, or that he was crazy and did not know what he was saying. Allah tells us that their hearts did not believe that, they knew that what they were saying about the Qur'an was falsehood.
