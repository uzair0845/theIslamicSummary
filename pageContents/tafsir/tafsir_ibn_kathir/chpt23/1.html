<h3>The Success Is For The Believers Whose Qualities Are Described Here</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:1"></p>
<p class="quote">Successful indeed are the believers</p>
<p>
	They have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded. These are the believers who have the following characteristics:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:2"></p>
<p class="quote">Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un</p>
<p>
	Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said: "(Khashiun) means those with fear and with tranquillity." It was reported from 'Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu' means the Khushu' of the heart. Khushu' in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:3"></p>
<p class="quote">And those who turn away from Al-Laghw</p>
<p>Al-Laghw refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:4"></p>
<p class="quote">And those who pay the Zakah</p>
<p>
	Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts. It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="91:9"></p>
<p class="quote">Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha).</p>
<p>
	It could also be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of
	the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:5-6"></p>
<p class="quote">
	And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.
</p>
<p>
	Means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:8"></p>
<p class="quote">Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants</p>
<p>
	When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge,
	they are true to their word.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:9"></p>
<p class="quote">And those who strictly guard their Salawat</p>
<p>
	Means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas'ud said: "I asked the
	Messenger of Allah pbuh, O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah?" He said,
</p>
<p class="arabic">الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا</p>
<p class="quote">Prayer at the appointed time.</p>
<p>I said, 'Then what' He said:</p>
<p class="arabic">بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن</p>
<p class="quote">Kindness to one's parents.</p>
<p> I said, 'Then what' He said:</p>
<p class="arabic">الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله</p>
<p class="quote">Jihad in the way of Allah.</p>
<p>It was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:10-11"></p>
<p>It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic">إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ الْجَنَّةَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ، فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمن</p>
<p class="quote">
	If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.
</p>
<p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic">مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَلَهُ مَنْزِلَانِ: مَنْزِلٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَمَنْزِلٌ فِي النَّارِ، فَإِنْ مَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ وَرِثَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَهُ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:11"></p>
<p class="quote">
	There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: "These are indeed the heirs."
