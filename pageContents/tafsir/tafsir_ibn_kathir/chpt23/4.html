<h3>Allah's Signs And Blessings In The Rain, Vegetation, Trees And Cattle</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:20">وَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ</p>
<p>
	Means the olive tree. Tur means a mountain. Some of the scholars said, "It is called Tur if there are trees on it, and if it is bare it i
	called Jabal, not Tur." And Allah knows best. Mount Sinai is the same as Tur Sinin, and it is the mountain on which Allah spoke to Musa bin
	Imran, peace be upon him, and in the surrounding mountains there are olive trees.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:20">تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ</p>
<p>Some scholars think it, linguistically, means that it brings forth oil. Others say it, linguistically, means "comes forth with oil."</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:20">وَصِبْغٍ</p>
<p>Meaning a condiment. Abd bin Humayd recorded in his Musnad and Tafsir from Umar that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic">ائْتَدِمُوا بِالزَّيْتِ وَادَّهِنُوا بِهِ فَإِنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ شَجَرَةٍ مُبَارَكَة</p>
<p class="quote">Eat (olive) oil as a condiment and apply it as oil, for it comes from a blessed tree.</p>
<p>It was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>
