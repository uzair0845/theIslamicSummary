<p class='arabic' verse='23:72'>أَمْ تَسْأَلُهُمْ خَرْجاً</p>
<p class='quote'>Or is it that you ask them for some Kharj</p>
<p>Al-Hasan said, "A reward." Qatadah said, "Some payment."</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:72'>فَخَرَاجُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ</p>
<p class='quote'>But the recompense of your Lord is better</p>
<p>
    means, you are not asking for any wages or payment or anything for calling them to right guidance, rather you are hoping for a great reward from Allah.
