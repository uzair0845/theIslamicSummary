<h3>The Sign Of Allah In The Progressive Creation Of Man From Clay Then From Nutfah And Thereafter</h3>
<p>
	Allah tells us how He initially created man from an extract of Tin. Ibn Jarir said, "Adam was called Tin because he was created from it." Qatadah said, "Adam was created from Tin." This is the more apparent meaning and is closer to the context, for Adam, upon him be peace, was created from a sticky Tin, which is a sounding clay of altered black smooth mud, and that is created from dust.
</p>

<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Musa that the Prophet said:</p>
<p class='arabic'>إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ مِنْ قَبْضَةٍ قَبَضَهَا مِنْ جَمِيعِ الْأَرْضِ، فَجَاءَ بَنُو آدَمَ عَلَى قَدْرِ الْأَرْضِ، جَاءَ مِنْهُمُ الْأَحْمَرُ وَالْأَبْيَضُ وَالْأَسْوَدُ وَبَيْنَ ذلِكَ، وَالْخَبِيثُ وَالطَّيِّبُ وَبَيْنَ ذلِك</p>
<p class='quote'>
	Allah created Adam from a handful which He picked up from throughout the earth, so the sons of Adam came forth accordingly, red and white and black and in between, evil and good and in between.
</p>
<p>Allah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:7-8">وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الْإِنسَانِ مِن طِينٍ, ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلَالَةٍ مِّن مَّاءٍ مَّهِينٍ</p>
<p class="quote">and He began the creation of man from clay. Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water</p>
<p>He also says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="77:20-21"></p>
<p class="quote">Did We not create you from a despised water? Then We placed it in a place of safety.</p>
<p>Meaning the womb, which is prepared and readily equipped.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:14">ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً</p>
<p>
	meaning, 'then We made the Nutfah, which is the water gushing forth that comes from the loins of man, and the ribs of woman. Then it becomes a red clot, like an elongated clot.' Ikrimah said, "This is blood."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:14">فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً</p>
<p class="quote">then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh</p>
<p>Which is like a piece of flesh with no shape or features.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:14">فَخَلَقْنَا الْمُضْغَةَ عِظَـماً</p>
<p class="quote">then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones</p>
<p>meaning, 'We gave it shape, with a head, two arms and two legs, with its bones, nerves and veins.'</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:14">فَكَسَوْنَا الْعِظَـمَ لَحْماً</p>
<p class="quote">then We clothed the bones with flesh</p>
<p>meaning, 'We gave it something to cover it and strengthen it.'</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:14">ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَـهُ خَلْقاً ءَاخَرَ</p>
<p class="quote">and then We brought it forth as another creation.</p>
<p>means, 'then We breathed the soul into it, and it moved and became a new creature, one that could hear, see, understand and move.'</p>
<p>
	Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, "We change it from one stage to another until it emerges as an infant, then it grows up through the stages of being a child, adolescent, youth, mature man, old man and senile man."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:16">ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَـهُ خَلْقاً ءَاخَرَ</p>
<p class='quote'>After that, surely you will die.</p>
<p>means, after first being created from nothing, you will eventually die.
