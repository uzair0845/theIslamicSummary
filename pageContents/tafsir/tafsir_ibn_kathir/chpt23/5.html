	Allah tells us about Nuh, peace be upon him, whom He sent him to his people to warn them of the severe punishment of Allah and His severe vengeance on those who associated partners with Him, defied His commands and disbelieved His Messengers:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="23:23">فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ</p>
<p>
	Meaning, "Do you not fear Allah when you associate others in worship with Him" The chiefs or leaders of his people said:
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="23:24">مَا هَـذَا إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ</p>
<p>
	meaning, 'he is putting himself above you and trying to make himself great by claiming to be a Prophet, but he is a human being like you, so how can he receive revelation when you do not!'
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="23:24">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا رَجُلٌ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ فَتَرَبَّصُوا بِهِ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ</p>
<p>
	means, 'he is crazy in his claim that Allah has sent him and chosen him from among you to receive revelation, wait until he dies, put up with him until you are rid of him.'
