<p class='arabic' verse='23:75'></p>
<p class='quote'>
    And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.
</p>
<p>
    Here Allah tells of their stubbornness in their disbelief, in that even if He had removed the calamity from them and made them understand the Qur'an, they still would not follow it; they would still persist in their disbelief and stubborn transgression.

    Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn Abbas: "Everything that is implied in the word لو is something that will never happen."
</p>

<p class='arabic' verse='23:76'>وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بِالْعَذَابِ</p>
<p class='quote'>And indeed We seized them with punishment</p>
<p>means, 'We tried and tested them with difficulties and calamities.'</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:76'>فَمَا اسْتَكَانُواْ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor did they invoke with submission to Him</p>
<p>
    means, that did not deter them from their disbelief and resistance, rather they persisted in their sin and misguidance.
</p>
<p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:</p>
<p class='quote'>
    Abu Sufyan came to the Messenger of Allah and said, 'O Muhammad, I ask you by Allah and by the ties of kinship between us, we have been reduced to eating camel hair and blood'. Then Allah revealed,
</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:76'>وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بِالْعَذَابِ فَمَا اسْتَكَانُواْ</p>
<p>
    The basis of this Hadith is in the Two Sahihs, where it says that the Messenger of Allah prayed against the Quraysh when he could not make any headway with them, and he said,
</p>
<p class='arabic'>اللَّهُمَّ أَعِنِّي عَلَيْهِمْ بِسَبْعٍ كَسَبْعِ يُوسُف</p>
<p class='quote'>O Allah, help me against them sending on them seven years (of famine) like the seven (years of drought) of Yusuf.</p>
<p class='arabic' verse='23:77'>حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَتَحۡنَا عَلَيۡہِم بَابً۬ا ذَا عَذَابٍ۬ شَدِيدٍ إِذَا هُمۡ فِيهِ مُبۡلِسُونَ</p>
<p class='quote'>Until, when We open for them the gate of severe punishment, then lo! they will be plunged in despair.</p>
<p>When the command of Allah reaches them and the Hour comes to them suddenly, and they are overtaken by the punishment of Allah which they were not expecting, then they will despair of any ease and goodness, and all their hopes will disappear.</p>
