<p>
    Allah states that the fact that He is One and that He is independent in His creation, control, dominion and guides one to realize that there is no God except Him and that none should be worshipped except Him Alone, with no partner or associate. He tells His Messenger Muhammad pbuh to say to the idolators who worship others besides Him, even though they admit His Lordship, that He has no partner in Lordship. But despite this they still attributed partners in divinity to Him, and worshipped others besides Him even though they recognized the fact that those whom they worshipped could not create anything, did not own anything, nor do they have any control over anything. However, they still believed that these creatures could bring them closer to Allah.

<p class='quote'>And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector</p>
<p>
    meaning, He is the greatest Master, and there is none greater than Him. His is the power to create and to command, and none can overturn or oppose His ruling. What He wills happens, and what He does not, will not happen.

    They will say: "(All that belongs) to Allah." Say: "How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?"
</p>
<p>means, how can your minds accept the idea of worshipping others besides Him.</p>

<p class='quote'>Nay, but We have brought them the truth</p>
<p>
    Which is the declaration that there is no god worthy of worship besides Allah, and the establishment of clear, definitive and sound proof to that effect.
