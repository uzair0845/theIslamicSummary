<h3>Refutation Of Those Who Think The Resurrection Is Unlikely To Happen</h3>

<p>
    Allah tells us how the idolators thought it unlikely that the resurrection would ever come to pass, and how they said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:10">أَءِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p>
<p>meaning, 'when our bodies have been scattered and have disintegrated and dispersed in the earth.'</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:10">أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ</p>
<p>
    (shall we indeed be created anew) means, 'after that, will we come back again' They thought it unlikely that this would happen, and in terms of their own feeble abilities it is indeed unlikely, but this is not the case with regard to the power of the One Who created them from nothing, Who when He wills a thing merely says to it, "Be!"and it is.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:11">قُلْ يَتَوَفَّـكُم مَّلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِى وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ</p>
<p>
    The apparent meaning of this Ayah is that the angel of death is a specific personality among the angels. The angel of death has helpers. It was reported in the Hadith that his helpers draw out the soul from the rest of the body until it reaches the throat, then the angel of death takes it. Mujahid said, "The earth is brought together for him and it is like a platter from which he takes whenever he wants."
