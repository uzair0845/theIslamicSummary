<h3>The Creation Of Man In Stages</h3>

<p>Allah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:7">وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الإِنْسَـنِ مِن طِينٍ</p>
<p>meaning, He created the father of mankind, Adam, from clay.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:8">ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلاَلَةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ مَّهِينٍ</p>
<p class="quote">Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water</p>
<p>
    means, they reproduce in this fashion, from a Nutfah which comes from the loins of men and from between the ribs of women.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:9">ثُمَّ سَوَّاهُ</p>
<p class="quote">Then He fashioned him in due proportion</p>
<p>means, when He created Adam from clay, He created him and gave him shape and made him upright.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:9">وَنَفَخَ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِهِ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ وَالاٌّفْئِدَةَ</p>
<p class="quote">and breathed into him the soul; and He gave you hearing, sight and the sense of deduction.</p>
<p>(the sense of deduction) means, reason.</p>
