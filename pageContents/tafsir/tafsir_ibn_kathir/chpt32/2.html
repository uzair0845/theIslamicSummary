<h3>The Qur'an Is The Book Of Allah In Which There Is No Doubt</h3>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:2">تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p>
<p>means, there is no doubt whatsoever that it has been revealed.</p>

<p>Allah tells us about the idolators:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:3">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ</p>
<p>They say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.</p>
