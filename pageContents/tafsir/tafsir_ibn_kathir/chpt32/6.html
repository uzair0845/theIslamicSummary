<h3>The Bad State In Which The Idolators Will Be On The Day Of Resurrection</h3>

<p>
    Allah tells us the state of the idolators on the Day of Resurrection and what they will say when they see the Resurrection and are standing before Allah -- may He be glorified -- humiliated and brought low, with their heads bowed, i.e., in shame. They will say:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:12">رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا</p>
<p>meaning, 'now we hear what You say and we will obey You.'</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:12">رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا</p>
<p class="quote">Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:12">نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ</p>
<p>
    means, 'now we are sure and we believe that Your promise is true and that the meeting with You is true.' But the Lord, may He be exalted, knows that if He were to send them back to this world, they would behave as they did previously, and they would reject and disbelieve in the signs of Allah and would go against His Messengers
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:13">وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لاّتَيْنَا كُلَّ نَفْسٍ هُدَاهَا</p>
<p class="quote">And if We had willed, surely We would have given every person his guidance</p>
<p>This is like the Ayah,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="10:99">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا</p>
<p class="quote">And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:13">وَلَـكِنْ حَقَّ الْقَوْلُ مِنْى لاّمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ</p>
<p class="quote">but the Word from Me took effect, that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together</p>
<p>
    from both classes, so their abode will be Hell and they will have no escape from it and no way out. We seek refuge with Allah and in His perfect Words from that.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="32:14">فَذُوقُواْ بِمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَآ</p>
<p class="quote">Then taste because of your forgetting the meeting of this Day of yours</p>
<p>
    means, it will be said to the people of Hell by way of rebuke: 'taste this punishment because you denied it and believed that it would never happen; you tried to forget about it and acted as if you had forgotten it.'
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:14">إِنَّا نَسِينَـكُمْ</p>
<p class="quote">Surely, We too will forget you</p>
<p>means, 'We will deal with you as if We have forgotten you.'</p>
