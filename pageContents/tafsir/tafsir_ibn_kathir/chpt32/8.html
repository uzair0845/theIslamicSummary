<h3>The Believer And The Rebellious Are Not Equal</h3>

<p>Allah says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:18"></p>
<p>
    i.e., before Allah on the Day of Resurrection. Ata' bin Yasar, As-Suddi and others mentioned that this was revealed concerning Ali bin Abi Talib and Uqbah bin Abi Mu'it. Hence Allah has judged between them when He said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:19">أَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَلَهُمْ جَنَّٰتُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ نُزُلًۢا</p>
<p>(for them are Gardens of Abode as an entertainment) means, something to welcome and honor a guest.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:21">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّكْبَرِ</p>
<p>
    Ibn Abbas said, "The near torment means diseases and problems in this world, and the things that happen to its people as a test from Allah to His servants so that they will repent to Him."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:22">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَآ</p>
<p>
    Qatadah said: "Beware of turning away from the remembrance of Allah, for whoever turns away from remembering Him will be the most misguided and the most in need, and the most guilty of sin." Allah says, warning the one who does that:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="32:22">إِنَّا مِنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ</p>
<p>meaning, 'We shall avenge Ourselves on those who do that in the strongest possible terms.'</p>
