<h3>How The People Of Makkah Turned Away From The Messenger And Opposed Him, And His Response</h3>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:31"></p>
<p>
	meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and Urwah bin Mas'ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:32">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p>
<p class="quote">Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord.</p>
<p>meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:32">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p>
<p>
	Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:32">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p>
<p>
	It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.
