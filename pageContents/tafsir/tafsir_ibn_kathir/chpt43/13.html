	Allah tells us how Fir'awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:51">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p>
<p class="quote">Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me.</p>
<p>
	Qatadah said, "They had gardens and rivers of flowing water."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:51">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p>
<p>
	means, 'do you not see my position of might and power.'
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:52">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p>
<p class="quote">Am I not better than this one who is despicable</p>
<p>
	As-Suddi said, "He was saying, 'indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'." By describing Musa as despicable he meant, as Sufyan said, insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, "He meant, weak." Ibn Jarir said, "He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:52">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p>
<p class="quote">And can scarcely express himself clearly</p>
<p>
	This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="20:36">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p>
<p class="quote">You are granted your request, O Musa</p>
<p>
	It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir'awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:53">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p>
<p class="quote">Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...</p>
<p>
	meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:55">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p>
<p>
	Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: "When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath." Ad-Dahhak said, it means "They made Us angry." This was also the view of Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Uqbah bin Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه</p>
<p class="quote">
	When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.
</p>
<p>Then he recited:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:55">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p>
<p>
	It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said: I was with Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, 'It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:55">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p>
<p>Umar bin Abdul-Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said: I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:55">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p>
