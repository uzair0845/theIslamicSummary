<p class="arabic" verse="43:44">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p>
<p>
	It was said that this means, 'it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments.
</p>
<p>
	It was also said that the meaning is 'it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:44">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p>
<p>means, 'about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:45"></p>
<p>
	Mujahid said that Abdullah bin Mas'ud recited it:
</p>
<p class="arabic">(وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا)</p>
<p class="quote">And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.</p>
<p>
	This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.
