<h3>The Idolators' Admission That Allah Is The Sole Creator, And Further Evidence Of That</h3>
<p>Allah says: 'If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:9"></p>
<p>
	In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate,
	yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:10">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p>
<p>
	means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk
	about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it
	should shake.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:10">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p>
<p>means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:10">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p>
<p>means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:11">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p>
<p>means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:12">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p>
<p>
	meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and
	all different kinds of animals.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:12">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p>
<p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:12">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p>
<p>
	means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and
	ride on their backs.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:13">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p>
<p>meaning, sit comfortably and securely.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:13">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p>
<p>means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:13">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p>
<p>means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:13">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p>
<p>
	means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done
	this by our own strength. Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: "We could not have done this
	ourselves."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:14">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p>
<p>
	means, 'We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah,
	mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of
	earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:197">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p>
<p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa).</p>
