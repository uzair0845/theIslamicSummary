<h3>Consolation To The Prophet For The Disbelief Of Quraysh</h3>
<p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:6">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p>
<p>meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:7">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p>
<p>means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:8">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p>
<p>
	means, 'We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these
	who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.'
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:8">وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p>
<p>
	Mujahid said, "The way of their life." Qatadah said, "Their punishment." Others said, "Their lesson,"
	i.e., 'We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same
	end as them.'
