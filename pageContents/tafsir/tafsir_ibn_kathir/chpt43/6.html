<h3>Ibrahim's Declaration Of Tawhid Here</h3>

<p>He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:26-28">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p>
<p class="quote">
	"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me." And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring.
</p>
<p>Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:28">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p>
<p class="quote">This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.</p>
<p>A similar view was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas. Ibn Zayd said, "The word of Islam."</p>
