<p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:57"></p>
<p class="quote">And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.</p>
<p>
	Several others narrated that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, "They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that." Qatadah said, "They were repelled by that and they laughed." Ibrahim An-Nakhai said, "They turned away."
</p>
<p>The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:98"></p>
<p class="quote">
	"Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it." Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with Abdullah bin Al-Zabari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, "By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell." Abdullah bin Az-Zabari said, "By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah Isa bin Maryam." Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what Abdullah bin Az-Zabari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah, who said:
</p>
<p class="arabic">كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه</p>
<p class="quote">
	"Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person." Then Allah revealed the words:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:101"></p>
<p class="quote">
	"Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)." Meaning that Isa, Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:26"></p>
<p class="quote">
	"And they say: 'The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).' Glory to Him! They are but honored servants." Concerning Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:57"></p>
<p class="quote">
	"And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat."
	Meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions Isa bin Maryam and says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:59-61">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَٰهُ مَثَلًۭا لِّبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ, وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُم مَّلَٰٓئِكَةًۭ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ, وَإِنَّهُۥ لَعِلْمٌۭ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p>
<p class="quote">
	"He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour." Meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:61">فَلَا تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ ۚ هَٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p>
<p class="quote">"Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path."</p>

<p>
	Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:
</p>
<p class="quote">This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:98"></p>
<p class="quote">The Quraysh said to him: "What about Isa bin Maryam?" He said:</p>
<p class="arabic">ذَاكَ عَبْدُ اللهِ وَرَسُولُه</p>
<p class="quote">
	"He is the servant and Messenger of Allah." They said, "By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took Isa son of Maryam as a lord." Then Allah said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:58">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُون</p>
<p class="quote">
	"They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people"
</p>

<p>
	Qatadah said, "They were saying, 'our gods are better than him'." Qatadah said: Ibn Masud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:58">أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا</p>
<p class="quote">Are our gods better or is this (meaning Muhammad)</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:58">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p>
<p>
	Means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (Isa) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:98">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p>
<p>
	The words "Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell", are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:61">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p>
<p>
	The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection. Mujahid said, "and he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour," means, sign and "One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:63">وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p>
<p class="quote">and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.</p>
<p>Ibn Jarir said, "This means religious matters, not worldly matters."</p>
