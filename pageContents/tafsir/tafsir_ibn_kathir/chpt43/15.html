<p class="arabic" verse="43:66">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not.</p>
<p>
	means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:67">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.</p>
<p>
	means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever.
