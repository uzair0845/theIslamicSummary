<h3>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h3>

<p>He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:33">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p>
<p class="quote">And were it not that mankind would have become of one community</p>
<p>
	means, 'were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:33">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p>
<p>
	means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:34">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p>
<p>means, all of that would be made of silver.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:35">وَزُخْرُفاً</p>
<p>means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:35">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p>
<p>
	All that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:
</p>
<p class="arabic">لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء</p>
<p class="quote">
	If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.
</p>
<p>It is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p class="arabic">لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة</p>
<p class="quote">Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.</p>
