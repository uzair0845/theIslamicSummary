<p class="arabic" verse="43:88">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">And his saying: "O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!"</p>
<p>
	Mujahid said concerning the Ayah, "Allah is stating what Muhammad said." Qatadah said, "These are the words of your Prophet, when he complained about his people to his Lord."
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:89">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p>
<p class="quote">So turn away from them,</p>
<p>means, from the idolators.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:89">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p>
<p class="quote">and say Salam (peace!)</p>
<p>
	means, 'do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'
</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:89">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">But they will come to know.</p>
<p>
	This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme.
