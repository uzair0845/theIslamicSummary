<h3>The Idolators Have No Proof</h3>

<p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:21">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p>
<p class="quote">Or have We given them any Book before this</p>
<p>means, before their idolatry.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:10">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">To which they are holding fast</p>
<p>means, with regard to what they are doing.</p>

<p class="arabic" verse="43:22">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p>
<p>
	meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah.
</p>
<p>
	Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:23"></p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:24">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p>
<p class="quote">
	"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following." They said: "Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent."
</p>
<p>
	'Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:24">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p>
	means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:25">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p>
<p>means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p>
