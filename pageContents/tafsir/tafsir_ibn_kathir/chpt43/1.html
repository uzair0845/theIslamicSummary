<h3>Which Was Revealed In Makkah</h3>
<p class="arabic">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:1-2">حـم, تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيم</p>
<p>
	means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs,
	which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:3">إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاهُ</p>
<p>meaning, revealed it,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:3">قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا</p>
<p>meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:3">لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p>
<p>means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p>
<p>
	This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of
	earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">وَأَنَّهُ</p>
<p>means, the Qur'an,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p>
<p>meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">لَدَيْنَآ</p>
<p>means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">لَّعَلِّى</p>
<p>means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:4">حَكِيمٌ</p>
<p>means, clear, with no confusion or deviation.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:5">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p>
<p>
	(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means,
	'do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded'.
	This was the view of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was
	the view favored by Ibn Jarir.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:5">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p>
<p>
	Qatadah said, "By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah
	rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them
	to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.'' What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is
	that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to
	the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He
	sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be
	established against those who were decreed to be.
