<h3>Condemnation Of The Idolators' Attribution Of Offspring To Allah</h3>

<p>
	Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An'am where He said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:136"></p>
<p class="quote">
	And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: "This is for Allah" according to their claim, "and this is for our partners."But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="53:21-22"></p>
<p>And Allah says here:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:15"></p>
<p>Then He says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:16"></p>
<p>This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:17"></p>
<p>
	means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:19">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p>
<p>means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:19">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p>
<p>meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females?</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:19">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p>
<p>means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:20">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p>
<p>
	means, (they said:) 'if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that.</li>
	<li>
		They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female.
	</li>
	<li>
		They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance.
	</li>
	<li>
		Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him.
	</li>
</ol>
